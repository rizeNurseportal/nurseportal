        <h2>6.3 Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</h2>
        
        <p>
            The expanded disability status scale (EDSS) is the assessment tool most widely used in 
            MS. The EDSS was created in 1983 by Dr Kurtzke<sup>43</sup> by expanding the DSS/Functional 
            Systems (FS) tools created he had created in 1955<sup>44</sup>. These two systems (EDSS and 
            FS) were used in what most probably were the first two multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, 
            placebo-controlled trials of therapy ever conducted in MS, the results of which were published 
            in 1957 and 1965<sup>44</sup>.

        </div>
        <p>
            The EDSS ranges from 0 – to 10 in 0.5- unit increments (except for the non-existence of a 0.5 
            grade) that represent sequentially higher levels of disability, with 0 relating to normal 
            neurological examination and 10 referring to death due to MS. Scoring on this scale is based 
            on examination by a trained examiner such as a neurologist or MS Specialist Nurse who grades 
            a person with MS according to a set of eight Functional System Scales (see Figure 7), combined 
            with the person’s current ambulatory function (in the middle range of the scales) and with 
            upper limb and bulbar function in the upper range of the scale.

            <b> The 8 Functional System Scales</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Pyramidal – </b><span>weakness or difficulty moving limbs</span></li>
            <li><b>Cerebellar – </b><span>ataxia, loss of coordination or tremor</span></li>
            <li><b>Brainstem – </b><span>problems related to impairment of cranial nerves</span></li>

            <li><b>Bowel and Bladder </b><span>function</span></li>
            <li><b>Visual</b> <span>function</span></li>
            <li><b>Cerebral </b><span>(or mental) functions</span></li>
            <li><b>Others</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each functional system is scored on a scale of 0 (no impairment or disability) to 5 or 6 
            (more severe impairment or disability).

            The EDSS can also be illustrated in a linear fashion, as in Figure 8.

        <p>
            Although the disabilities are placed in an approximate order of how they are likely 
            to occur as the disease progresses, progression through these stages is unlikely to be linear.
        </p>
        <div class="keypoint">
            The EDSS is in widespread use and its common language is familiar to neurologists. It is 
            considered easy to use being based on neurological examination, uses a relatively 
            straightforward scoring system and has considerable evidence to support its reliability.

            However, the EDSS has been widely criticised, with some of the limitations being cited as<sup>45</sup>: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>poor responsiveness in people with MS with greater disability (EDSS score ≥6.0)</span></li>
            <li><span>low reproducibility at the lower end of the scale</span></li>
            <li><span>heavy reliance on ambulation in the middle range</span></li>
            <li><span>limited assessment of upper limb function</span></li>
            <li><span>insensitivity to cognitive impairment.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            A further limitation is the non-linear nature of progression through the EDSS. Clearly, 
            disability, as assessed by the EDSS does not naturally continue to progress at a similar 
            rate throughout the course of a patient’s MS. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, the EDSS does not reflect many of the distressing symptoms of MS such as fatigue 
            and pain, does not properly assess cognition, and most importantly, it does not include the 
            individual’s perspective on their disease.
