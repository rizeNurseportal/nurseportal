                Surveys of people with MS indicate that the majority of people feel they receive
                insufficient support in understanding and making sense of their diagnosis<sup>1</sup>.
                Although approaches to delivering the diagnosis have improved as clinicians have
                become better educated, there is still room for improvement. Therefore, it is important
                that the MS Nurse is able to explain the diagnosis, the tests used during the diagnosis
                process and any likely future interventions to the individual following their consultation
                with the neurologist. This will empower the person and will also help to build the
                trust and communication needed to optimise patient care.

                Diagnostic criteria for MS have evolved considerably to align with the MRI facility
                – ranging from the early, clinically oriented Poser criteria introduced in 1983
                to the comprehensive, revised McDonald Criteria published in 2001 and 2005 and updated
                in 2010<sup>2-5</sup>. Working with a person with suspected MS to arrive at an accurate
                diagnosis involves much more than checking off a list of criteria. There are many
                “real world” factors to consider, such as the inter-centre variability of MRI results,
                patients whose presentation does not fit neatly into the diagnostic criteria, and
                the emotional upheaval and socio-economic burden that this diagnosis brings for
                patients and their families.
            </p>
            <p>
                This module will explain the criteria along with the associated diagnostic tools,
                their results and consequences in a manner that a MS Nurse can easily understand
                and interpret, and then relay to a person who has MS. This is important not only
                from the point of view of information exchange, but also for the vital development
                of an equal relationship built on trust between the person and the MS Nurse.

                Additionally, as the person with MS moves forward from the point of diagnosis, it
                is important that any signs of relapse in the patient are identified and differentiated
                from other related, but not necessarily clinically relevant, factors such as bladder
                infections. Identifying a relapse, and therefore being able to treat the patient
                as soon as possible, may reduce the impact of that relapse (time to recovery and
                potentially level of effect of relapse). Knowing when a relapse has occurred and
                the effects and consequences of the relapse can help in building the individual’s
                history and indicate disease activity. Therefore, accurate history taking and note
                making are also an important aspect of the role of the MS Nurse.
