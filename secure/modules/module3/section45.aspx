        <h2>4.5 Laboratory Tests and Biomarkers</h2>
        <p>
            General laboratory tests such as metabolic panel and complete blood cell count, erythrocyte 
            sedimentation rate (ESR), vitamin B12 level, double-stranded DNA test, rheumatoid factor concentration, 
            thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and, if suggested by the history, human immunodeficiency 
            virus ((HIV) and Borrelia titers are useful more for excluding a diagnosis of MS (by indicating other 
            conditions), rather than a help in the positive diagnosis of MS<sup>40,41</sup>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Validated biomarkers of clinical disease activity would be extremely helpful in the diagnosis of MS. 
            Reliable biomarkers would assist in choosing initial therapy, monitoring response to therapy and even 
            helping in the a <i>priori</i> prediction of therapeutic failure. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned previously in this section, the presence of OCBs in the CSF is a well-validated biomarker 
            that is useful in the initial diagnosis of MS. The discovery of antibodies to aquaporin-4 in patients 
            with NMO identifies patients with a fundamentally different underlying pathophysiology and clinical 
            course from MS. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The usefulness of neutralising antibodies to interferon-beta (IFNβ) in identifying treatment failure and 
            possibly guiding changes in therapy is still a matter of debate.
        </p>
        <p>
            While numerous other candidate biomarkers in serum and CSF have been described, none have yet been 
            validated for clinical use. The availability of multiple genetic and protein microarray technology 
            may assist in identifying more reliable candidate biomarkers or patterns of multiple biomarkers, and 
            offer improved specificity. The heterogeneity of MS may necessitate the identification of individualised 
            biomarkers to assist in diagnosis and therapy<sup>41</sup>.

                How would you explain the investigation steps toward a diagnosis and can you think about what the 
                term “clinical diagnosis” may mean to someone who is undergoing investigation for possible MS? 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="nursetippopup1" class="nursetippopup">

                The principle consideration when diagnosing MS is whether the person fulfils the diagnosis on a clinical 
                level. A ‘clinical diagnosis’ means that, through questioning and a neurological assessment, it is 
                apparent the person fulfils the ‘picture’ of someone with MS, and sufficient evidence of this is seen 
                in their history of symptoms and the results of their neurological examination. The Neurologist will 
                accumulate evidence from the history and examination and if appropriate give a ‘clinical diagnosis’ 
                to the person and explain there is now a need for laboratory investigations to be carried out to confirm 
                the clinical picture. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It can take time for these investigations to be carried out and for the results to be interpreted, and 
                this elongated waiting time represents a period of great uncertainty to the individual and their family. 
                It could be said that the diagnosis should only be given once all the tests are completed, but because 
                the diagnosis of MS is so significant, it is important for the Neurologist to give a ‘warning shot’ to 
                prepare the person for what could be their outcome. There is still no one specific diagnostic test for 
                MS so a package of laboratory investigations is valuable, although often not all of these are necessary. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For those suspected of having Primary Progressive MS, the diagnostic period can be particularly elongated 
                because the diagnostic criteria can only be achieved once the person has demonstrated disease progression 
                over a period of time. This can be an extremely frustrating time for the person. 
            </p>

        <div class="nursetip">

            <p>
                How would you support the family during this time?
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="nursetippopup2" class="nursetippopup">
            <p>                
                It is not only the person who is undergoing diagnosis of MS who can feel they are on a rollercoaster 
                of a journey, it is their family too. The time it takes to diagnose MS can be a time of fear, distress 
                and great uncertainty for some; therefore it is important that this is acknowledged with the family and 
                they are given the opportunity to talk and ask any questions they may have with someone who is 
                knowledgeable about MS and its diagnosis. Whilst it is important to comfort the family at this time, 
                remember they will never forget (or forgive) any false reassurance. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important that the nurse shows empathy to the family at this time; phrases such as “this must 
                be a very difficult time for you and your family” or “it is obvious you love your ... very much and 
                you feel a little helpless at the moment...” will give the family the permission that they need to 
                be able to talk to you and may encourage effective two way communication.    
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to educate the family with the process involved in diagnosing MS and that they 
                are aware that the, sometimes prolonged, diagnostic time can represent a period of uncertainty. 
                It is also important to explain that their loved one can fluctuate in mood and become fearful 
                and frustrated; it maybe that they take this frustration out on their family. Family members may 
                want to know what they can do to support their loved one and the potential of their role can be 
                explained. They could (for example) accompany them to appointments as ‘two sets of ears are better 
                than one” and can also be emotionally comforting, talk to their loved one, but do not offer over 
                (or under) optimism about the outcome of the findings. Reinforce how essential listening to their 
                loved one can be - they should not underestimate what they can do to support loved ones at this time.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is essential that the family is aware of where and/or who they can go to if they want to talk 
                about their concerns and worries and they are given the details of organisations or individuals
                who understand what they are going through - this makes it a far less lonely experience. These 
                resources will differ from country to country of course. It is essential to tease out the many 
                myths and misconceptions about MS, so ask the family members what their previous exposure has 
                been to MS so that family can be educated with accurate and up to date information. It is important 
                that sufficient information is given to the family; providing minimalist information or using 
                professional jargon will almost certainly cause anxiety. They may want to look for information 
                about the diagnosis themselves, therefore ‘signpost’ them to reputable web sites or booklets that 
                will provide them with accurate information.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Parents can feel guilty if their child is undergoing the diagnosis of MS and may feel that they 
                must have played a direct part in their child’s diagnosis. Again, it is important to educate 
                honestly and accurately and explain that it is not because of something that they have or haven’t 
                done for their child.
