        <h2>3.3 The McDonald Criteria</h2>
        <p>
            The McDonald Criteria were first introduced in 2001<sup>3</sup>, but were revised in 2005<sup>4</sup> 
            and 2010<sup>5</sup> with the aim of simplifying and speeding up the diagnosis of MS without losing specificity.
        </p>
        <p>
            These diagnostic criteria have been previously criticised for “replacing clinical assessment”; however 
            this was refuted by the authors who stressed in the latest revisions that the McDonald Criteria should 
            only be applied in those people with clinical symptoms suggestive of MS or demyelinating disease<sup>5</sup>. 
            Diagnostic criteria are not substitutes for clinical examination and history but can validate and confirm them.

            Diagnostic criteria are not substitutes for clinical examination and history but can validate and confirm them. 
        </div>
        <p>
            The McDonald Criteria use the following evaluations to support a diagnosis:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>clinical features (evidence of clinical attacks based on symptoms which may 
                        indicate evidence of lesions)</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These are supplemented where appropriate and available by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>MRI</span></li>
            <li><span>cerebrospinal fluid evaluation.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3.1 The 2010 McDonald Criteria</h3>
        <p>
            Recently, the International Panel on Diagnosis of MS published the 2010 revisions to the 2005 
            McDonald Criteria<sup>5</sup>. The 2010 revisions focussed on simplifying the criteria to improve 
            comprehension and utility. Additionally, the panel assessed the criteria’s appropriateness in 
            populations that differ from the largely Western Caucasian adult populations from which they were 
            derived.
        </p>
        <p>
            Changes from the 2005 McDonald criteria that were recommended, included the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>
                    Simplification of <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1">MRI criteria for DIS</a>   
                    (see Table 3).</span></li>
        </ul>

        <div id="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdivepopup" >
            The MRI criteria previously used were based on the Barkhof/Tintoré criteria, which had 
            been seen as difficult to interpret by non-imaging specialists<sup>16-19</sup>. The MAGNIMS 
            work, reported by Swanton and colleagues<sup>20,21</sup> and summarized by Montalban and colleagues<sup>22</sup>, 
            developed a new set of criteria for the demonstration of DIS (Table 3) which were to be 
            adopted by the 2010 McDonald Criteria over the Barkhof/Tintoré criteria.

            <p>
                In the 2005 criteria, the requirement for a gap of at least 90 days after the CIS to obtain a 
                first reference MRI scan with which to compare a second MRI scan to demonstrate a new lesion 
                was shortened to 30 days. Tur and colleagues<sup>23</sup> further showed that completely removing 
                this requirement did not compromise specificity. Therefore, the current revision of the McDonald 
                Criteria allows a new T2 lesion to establish DIT, irrespective of the timing of the baseline MRI.
            </p>
            <p>
                As for the presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions to demonstrate DIT, again work by the MAGNIMS 
                group has demonstrated that, in patients with a typical CIS, a single brain MRI study that shows 
                both gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions is specific for predicting early development 
                of a second attack<sup>22,24</sup>. The 2010 McDonald Criteria now indicate that the presence of 
                both gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions on the baseline MRI scan may substitute for a 
                follow-up scan to confirm DIT (Table 4).

                         <b>a.</b> An attack (relapse exacerbation) is defined as patient-reported or 
                         objectively observed events typical of an acute inflammatory demyelinating event 
                         in the CNS, current or historical, with duration of at least 24 hours, in the 
                         absence of fever or infection. It should be documented by contemporaneous neurological 
                         examination, but some historical events with symptoms and evolution characteristics 
                         for MS, but for which no objective neurological findings are documented, can provide 
                         reasonable evidence of a prior demylinating event. Reports of paroxysmal symptoms 
                         (historical or current) should however consist of multiple episodes occurring over 
                         not less than 24 hours. Before a definite diagnosis of MS can be made, at least 1 
                         attack must be correlated by findings on neurological examination, visual evoked 
                         potential response in patients reporting prior visual disturbance, or MRI consistent 
                         with demylisation in the area of the CNS implicated in the historical report of neurological symptoms.

                         <b>b.</b> Clinical diagnosis based on objective clinical findings for 2 attacks is most secure. 
                         Reasonable historical evidence for 1 past attack, the absence of documented objective 
                         neurological findings, can include historical events with symptoms and evolution characteristics 
                         for a prior inflammatory demylinating event; at least 1 attack, however, must be supported by 
                         objective findings.
                         <br />  <br />  
                         <b>c.</b> No additional tests are required. However, it is desirable that any diagnosis of MS be made 
                         with access to imaging based on these criteria. If imaging or other tests (for instance CSF) 
                         are undertaken and are negative, extreme caution needs to be taken before making a diagnosis 
                         of MS, and alternative diagnoses must be considered. There must be no better explanation for 
                         the clinical presentation, and objective evidence must be present to support a diagnosis of MS.
                         <br /> <br />   
                         <b>d.</b>  Gadolinium-enhancing lesions are not required; symptomatic lesions are excluded from 
                         consideration in subjects with brainstem of spinal cord syndromes.

            Table 5. 2010 McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of MS
        </p>

        <p>
            In the 2010 McDonald criteria, the panel points out that these criteria have not been fully validated in 
            Asian and Latin American populations, and suggest that further studies are required to confirm sensitivity 
            and specificity in these populations, particularly with regards to the issue of differential diagnosis 
            of other conditions, namely neuromyelitis optica and infectious diseases that may be more prevalent in 
            certain areas of such regions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the 2010 McDonald Criteria may result in a more rapid diagnosis of MS, something that may avoid a 
            lot of the patient anxiety when diagnosis is a prolonged affair. The sensitivity and specificity of MS 
            diagnosis should be equivalent or better with the 2010 criteria than with the 2005 Criteria, so the 
            level of confidence in the diagnosis should still be high – allowing the MS Nurse to be able to reassure 
            people diagnosed with MS that their diagnosis is correct.

        <p>
            Although the MS Nurse is not usually involved in making the final diagnosis, knowledge of the criteria 
            applied may be useful in discussions with people diagnosed with MS in the days and weeks after the 
            neurologist has confirmed the diagnosis. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, it should be reiterated that diagnostic criteria should only be applied in cases where the 
            individual has experienced a typical CIS. Patients with non-specific symptoms and/or nonspecific MRI 
            findings should be referred to secondary or tertiary MS centres where available.
