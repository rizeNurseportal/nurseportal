                Assessment tools are commonly used to assess MS-related disability and its evolution 
                throughout the course of the condition. In charting the disease over time, they are used to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Monitor the progression of the disease in people with MS, allowing caregivers to
                            provide the most appropriate therapy as the person’s disease progresses. </span></li>
                <li><span>Assess (in clinical research) the effectiveness of the therapy on trial. </span></li>
            </ul>

            Assessment tools are commonly used to assess MS-related disability and its evolution throughout 
            the course of the condition. 
        </div>
        <p>
            To fulfil these roles, a tool needs to be <b>concise</b>, <b>consistent</b> and <b>reproducible</b>. 
            The rigorous nature of clinical  trials requires assessment tools that are more amenable to scientific 
            analyses. However, the needs of caregivers and MS Nurses are such  that they prefer an approach that is 
            more personal to the needs of the individuals with MS. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many assessment tools. Here we will review three of the most widely used tools:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)</span></li>
            <li><span>Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC)</span></li>
            <li><span>Multiple Sclerosis Severity Scale (MSSS)</span></li>
        </ul>

                Which assessment tools do you routinely use? How do you communicate results of these tools to your patients?

                The Guys Neurological Disability Score is ideal for assessing the ability/disability of 
                person with MS. It is a questionnaire that is very patient-orientated and much more nursing 
                friendly compared to some of the other ‘medical’ assessment tools such as the EDSS. It 
                assesses the patient’s disability in the previous month by patient interview and can be 
                completed by any healthcare worker. It is practical and capable of incorporating patients’ 
                views of their disability in a structured manner. It can be administered over the phone, 
                completed by the patient in the waiting room, or can be posted to the patient to complete 
                prior to their appointment. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It should be discussed with the patient that you are completing an assessment tool and 
                why you are doing this.  Any results should be explained in depth with the patient so 
                they are not disturbed or frightened by any of the findings.
