        <h2>5.2 How to Identify a Relapse</h2>
        <p>
            Relapses, or exacerbations, in MS occur as inflammatory processes acutely damage or destroy 
            the myelin sheath around axons or the axons themselves in the CNS (see Module 1), giving rise 
            to new and transient abnormalities in the neurological examination (signs) and/or to symptoms. 
            Attacks are usually followed by remission of signs/symptoms, and successful recovery in the 
            earlier phase of the condition. ‘Attacks’ were defined by the 2010 Diagnostic Criteria Panel 
            as “patient-reported symptoms or objectively observed signs typical of an acute inflammatory 
            demyelinating event in the CNS, current or historical, with duration of at least 24 hours, in 
            the absence of fever or infection”. Relapses must be differentiated from pseudo-attacks, most 
            frequently occurring in the presence of fever. When signs and symptoms accumulate with no apparent 
            remission, the situation is described as clinical progression, as it occurs from onset in people 
            with primary-progressive MS and, in some people, after a period of relapses (secondary-progressive 
            MS)<sup>42</sup>.

                 How would you support someone with MS to identify what a relapse is and gain the knowledge and 
                 skill to be able to identify the difference between a relapse and fluctuation of symptoms?

                It is often difficult for people with MS to comprehend what really is a relapse, especially because 
                many other environmental and emotional factors can trigger increased MS symptoms. It is essential 
                that patients are educated at an early stage in regards to ‘what is a relapse’ so that it does not 
                frighten them and they are able to either effectively self manage their symptoms or know when and 
                where to ask for help. If they are not educated correctly people may seek help and advice frequently 
                as their symptoms fluctuate over a period of time. Explain to the patient what they could do to 
                establish whether this is a relapse, such as resting more or staying out of the heat. Explain why 
                it is important not to panic and conjure up visions of increased disability. It is helpful to explain 
                to patients that a useful question to consider is "Is it interfering with activity or causing significant 
                pain?” If the answer is yes to either of these, then they should ask for help. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Patients need to be educated regarding the difference between a relapse and disease progression. It can 
                be explained that a relapse comes on acutely, or more often sub acutely; if the  symptoms have come on 
                insidiously over a matter of months this is less likely to reflect a relapse and more likely to be disease 
                progression.  The patient could be told that a relapse involves symptoms that last at least one but, more 
                commonly, a number of days. To be considered a new relapse, it should be explained that symptoms must occur 
                at least 30 days after the start of a previous episode. Symptoms similar to those of a relapse can occur 
                when there is an infection, often a urine or respiratory infection. It is therefore important to rule out 
                infection before thinking that new symptoms are definitely due to a relapse and advice needs to be provided 
                on who the patient should contact to do this and when. In addition to education, it is important that this 
                is supplemented with written material and specific websites that can enable a patient to complete a 
                checklist regarding their symptoms. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to explain what is happening physiologically when a relapse occurs to decrease anxiety. 
                The symptoms experienced will depend on the specific area of the brain or spinal cord affected. Some 
                relapses are relatively mild while others may cause more serious problems. It is important that patients 
                understand what triggers relapses such as fatigue, an infection and even stress, although the evidence 
                relating to the latter remains controversial. Lifestyle issues are also important in reducing the risk 
                of relapses. A well balanced diet and regular exercise will promote good health and can help reduce 
                the risk of relapse triggers such as infection. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You could give a checklist to patients such as ‘you are experiencing a relapse if you answer “yes” to 
                the following questions’:
            </p>
        <ul>            
            <li><span>Am I experiencing new symptoms or worsening of existing symptoms? </span></li>
            <li><span>Has this worsening happened over the course of 24 hours to a couple of days? </span></li>
            <li><span>Have these symptoms lasted more than 24 hours? </span></li>
            <li><span>Has it been at least a month since my last relapse? (In other words, had these symptoms been 
                        non-existent or stable for at least 30 days before they appeared or got worse?) </span></li>
            <li><span>Am I free of fever or infection?</span></li>
        </ul>
        </div>


        <p>            
            Authentic exacerbations occur at least 30 days after any previous episode began, and are typically 
            expected to last for at least 24 hours. In an exacerbation, symptoms often involve the evolution of novel 
            symptoms not previously experienced by the patient but also can include re-appearance of previously 
            experienced symptoms (although in such instances, differentiation from pseudo-attacks can be very challenging). 
            Symptoms usually appear over a few hours (possibly days) and can last from a few days to many months. This 
            will be difficult for the patient, not only physically but also emotionally, and the MS Nurse can assist and 
            provide support at these times<sup>42</sup>. 
        </p>
        <div class="keypoint">
            When signs and symptoms accumulate with no apparent remission, the situation is described as clinical progression.
        </div>
        <p>
            Screening tools for assessing symptoms and disease progression will be discussed in the next section of this Module.

            Clearly, continuing fatigue is not necessarily a sign of a relapse but if acute, profound in onset 
            fatigue comes suddenly, and remains for more than a few days, then further investigation is warranted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since it has been well established that high-dose, short-term intravenous corticosteroid therapy 
            provides symptomatic relief and shortens the recovery phase of acute disease-related attacks, it 
            is important that such therapy is offered to all patients. The final decision on giving 
            corticosteroids should only be made after a careful risk–benefit ratio assessment, as corticosteroids 
            are not free of side effects and recovery will eventually take place regardless of treatment. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If the person with MS has a surge of symptoms in clear temporal relationship with a temporary elevation 
            in core body temperature due to infection (e.g., UTI), fever, exercise or ambient temperature, these 
            symptoms should not be considered a relapse rather as a pseudo-exacerbation. It is essential therefore 
            that the MS Nurse establishes, by close questioning and referral to patient history and notes, that the 
            person is not in any of these situations.

                                Ask the patient did the symptoms come on sub acutely/acutely. When did they start? Have they been there 
                                continuously for more than 24 hours? Ask them to describe how their condition now is different from how 
                                they were 30 days previously. What symptoms they are experiencing? Are these symptoms new or have they 
                                had them before? Does anything make them worse?

                                It is important to establish how these ‘new’ or increased symptoms affect them on a day to day 
                                basis - what can’t they do now that they could do a few days ago. Ask them to describe how these 
                                ‘new’ or increased symptoms impair them day to day such as at home or at work.

                                Prior to confirming a relapse, it is essential to rule out a pseudo-relapse, although this is not 
                                always straightforward. It is important to ask the patient if their symptoms seem to come on or 
                                increase when they are overheated. This does not mean that the patient is having an MS relapse, 
                                but rather it could be Uhtoff's phenomenon, where heat can uncover older MS symptoms.

                                It can also be caused by physical or psychological stress, fatigue often increases MS symptoms.  
                                It is essential to ask the patient about their activity of late - they may have had a particularly 
                                strenuous or stressful life style or have been exercising more than usual which could increase their 
                                fatigue levels and so exacerbate existing neurological symptoms. Typically, once the underlying 
                                cause of the pseudo-relapse is eliminated, the neurological symptoms will resolve.

                                History of recent infection is essential because it is important to ensure the person does not 
                                have an infection prior to administration of steroids. Ask the patient questions about their 
                                general health. Ask them if they have had any infections recently or have been exposed to someone 
                                with an infection. Ask the patient to consider their body from their head down to their feet when 
                                considering if they have an infection. If there is a recent infection, wait for this to disappear 
                                before reassessment for steroids. Take a routine Mid Stream of Urine even if the patient is 
                                asymptomatic of any bladder symptoms.

                                It is known that the menstrual cycle can affect MS symptoms. Some women report they experience 
                                increased fatigue and exacerbation of their other pre existing symptoms approximately 7 days 
                                before and 3 days into their period. Therefore it is important to ask women questions concerning 
                                where they are in their menstrual cycle.

                                It is important to carry out some form of objective measurement such as a timed 100 metre 
                                walk or a Nine Hole Peg Test. Of course it is advantageous to already have carried this out when 
                                the patient was ‘stable’ so baselines can be established and then compared to once the patient 
                                comes to see you regarding a ‘relapse’. However, it is important to do this during relapse too 
                                so any recovery can be monitored and it can be established whether steroids do help the individual
