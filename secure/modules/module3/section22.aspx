        <h2>2.2 Neurological Assessments</h2>
        <p>
            The clinical diagnosis of MS involves the use of various neurological assessments. Most 
            clinicians will begin with an assessment of mental status followed by assessment of the 
            cranial nerves, motor system, sensory system, coordination and gait. However, there is no 
            single, universally accepted sequence of the assessments that make up a neurological 
            examination<sup>6</sup>. It is also important to initially assess the level of understanding 
            in the patient and any cognitive impairment that may affect the person’s capacity to report 
            accurately during these tests.
        </p>
        <div class="keypoint">
            Most clinicians will begin with an assessment of mental status followed by assessment of the 
            cranial nerves, motor system, sensory system, coordination and gait.
        </div>
        <p>
            The <b>cranial nerve examination</b> involves checking the fundi, visual fields, pupil size and 
            reactivity of the eye. Also examined are extraocular movements, hearing and facial movements.
        </p>
        <p>
            A <b>muscle examination</b> is carried out to investigate muscle strength, atrophy and tone of the 
            extremities. To assess upper muscle strength, the patient may be checked for pronator drift 
            and strength of wrists or finger extensors and flexors as well as proximal muscles. To assess 
            pronator drift (see Figure 1) the individual is asked to hold both arms fully extended in front 
            of them at shoulder level, with the palms upwards. An upper motor neuron weakness may be 
            revealed by a tendency for one of the arms to drift on the affected side when the eyes are 
            closed. Many other manoeuvres may be used to detect subtle strength deficits.
        </p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            Patients should also be tested for lower extremity strength by, for instance, having the individual 
            walk normally, then on heels and toes. An in-depth examination usually involves investigation of the 
            muscle appearance, tone, strength and reflexes, including muscle stretch reflexes, skin reflexes and 
            primitive reflexes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>sensory examination</b> is used to check if the individual can feel joint movement or position, 
            vibration, light touch, pain and the temperature of an object in each distal extremity. In those 
            individuals who are cooperative and have a good understanding of the assessment, the sensory 
            examination can be extremely helpful in establishing the precise location of a lesion. In others 
            who are less aware, it may be of little benefit. The five primary sensory modalities that should be 
            tested in both limbs are light touch, pain, temperature, vibration and joint position. Light touch 
            is assessed by stimulating the skin with single, very gentle touches of the examiner’s finger or a 
            cotton wool swab; pain is tested using a new pin; and temperature is assessed using a metal object 
            that has been immersed in cold and warm water. Vibration is assessed with a tuning fork, which is 
            made to vibrate and located on a bony prominence, such as the malleolus in the feet, or any area 
            that can respond to vibration.

        </div>
        <p>
            <b>To test coordination</b>, examinations include rapid, alternating movement of fingers and feet, 
            the finger-to-nose manoeuvre and the heel-to-knee manoeuvre. Finger-to-nose testing is primarily 
            an assessment of cerebellar function: the individual is asked to touch his or her index finger to 
            their nose and then to the examiner’s outstretched finger, which moves with each repetition; this 
            manoeuvre is performed with the patient’s eyes open.

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            The <b>gait</b> of the patient is examined by observation of the patient walking normally, on heels and toes, 
            and along a straight line, putting each foot immediately after the other (tandem walk).
        </p>
        <p>
            All the tests above would be carried out on a person who had been referred to the neurologist 
            following an episode of neurological disturbance, either sensory (e.g., numbness, paresthesias, 
            unpleasant sensation of tightness around the thorax – the “MS hug”) or of any other kind (e.g., 
            optic neuritis, diplopia, Bell palsy). A first-time-ever clinical presentation of MS is usually 
            termed a ‘clinically isolated syndrome’ (CIS) and it is usually classified according to the 
            topography of the suspected lesions: optic neuritis, myelitis, brainstem/cerebellum syndromes, 
            hemispheric syndromes, poliregional syndromes or other. The physical tests above, together with 
            the anamnesis of the patient, would raise the clinical suspicion of MS and would prompt the 
            performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which will be very useful to increase the certainty 
            of a definite MS diagnosis according to widely accepted diagnostic criteria. Briefly, MRI is used to 
            reveal lesions in the central nervous system (CNS). These lesions may indicate areas of possible 
            damage to the myelin sheaths on axons in the CNS which occur in people with MS. Diagnosis of MS 
            requires MRI showing multiple lesions disseminated in both time and space. (MRI is covered in more 
            detail later in this module).
        </p>

            Lesions may indicate areas of possible damage to the myelin sheaths on axons in the CNS which 
            occur in people with MS.
        </div>
        <p>
            <b>Dissemination in time and space</b> is one of the core clinical indicators of MS. What this means is 
            that episodes of symptoms or discovery of new lesions by MRI should indicate different evolution 
            in time (i.e., chronicity) and be located in different areas of the CNS (brain and spinal cord).
        </p>
        <div class="keypoint">
            Dissemination of lesions ‘in time’ refers to evidence of increased number of lesions over time. 
          
            Dissemination of lesions ‘in space’ refers to evidence of disease lesions affecting more than 
            one part of CNS.
          
        </div>
        
        <p>
            The diagnosis of MS requires a number of factors, as originally set out by Schumacher and 
            colleagues<sup>7</sup>, with modifications by Poser and colleagues<sup>2</sup>, and those 
            detailed in the recently revised McDonald Criteria, which will be discussed in further detail 
            later in the next section of this module<sup>5</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other clinical tests which are used to help confirm the diagnosis of MS are: evaluation of 
            cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) for oligoclonal bands (OCB), evoked potentials (delayed potentials 
            indicating myelin damage), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and several biomarkers (mainly 
            for exclusion/indication of another diagnosis). These tests will be detailed later in this module.

            It is important to be able to explain to individuals that the neurological tests they will be 
            required to undergo, or have already had performed, are relevant to their diagnosis and why; 
            also that the combination of the clinical and radiological (MRI) evidence is usually required 
            to confirm a diagnosis of MS.

        <h3> 2.2.1 Differential Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>
            Since some of the signs and symptoms of MS are not exclusive to MS and may be also indicators of 
            other diseases, it is important to be sure of the MS diagnosis by reasonably excluding such 
            alternative conditions. 
        </p>
        <div class="keypoint">
            It is important to be sure of the MS diagnosis by excluding alternative conditions.
        </div>
        <p>
            There are a number of <b>red flags</b> that should raise the index of suspicion about the MS diagnosis. 
            These include: relentlessly progressive course, particularly in younger individuals; prominent or 
            persistent headache; prominent cortical features (seizures, aphasia, neglect syndromes); abrupt 
            and/or transient (few minutes to hours) duration of symptoms; presence of peripheral neuropathy; 
            and involvement of other organ systems, such as cardiac, hematologic, or rheumatologic.

        </div>
        <p>
            The differential diagnosis of MS is extensive, so accurate and detailed clinical history taking 
            is essential. Review of patient notes can help to reveal the correct diagnosis and one of the 
            key points of all diagnostic criteria has been that “there must be no better explanation for 
            the clinical picture”. Usually major categories of diseases to consider can include vasculitic, 
            infectious, metabolic, neoplastic and neurodegenerative processes. Laboratory screening evaluations 
            for other causes include complete blood cell counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rates, vitamin B12 
            levels, auto-antibody tests, thyroid-stimulating and thyroid hormone levels, and if suggested by 
            the history, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Borrelia antibody titers. In any case, the 
            list of possible tests to undertake is very long, and should be designed according to the 
            clinical presentation of the patient. Table 1 lists common differential diagnoses.

            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup2">acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)</a>. 
            These two conditions may be considered as a part of the MS spectrum of idiopathic inflammatory 
            demyelinating disorders. In patients who present with optic neuritis and/or transverse myelitis, 
            the diagnosis of NMO must be considered<sup>8,9</sup>. ADEM, which may sometimes be confused with 
            an initial episode of MS, tends to occur more commonly in children after a viral illness or 
            vaccination, is monophasic, and does not show a female predominance, as does MS.

                <b>The Wingerchuk diagnostic criteria for NMO</b> published in 2006<sup>8</sup> state that in addition to optic 
                neuritis and/or transverse myelitis, the diagnosis of NMO requires at least two of the 
                following supportive criteria:                 
            </p>

                <b>Miller and colleagues</b><sup>9</sup> proposed a new set of diagnostic criteria for NMO in which three 
                major criteria are required, together with at least one minor criterion. <br />
                Major criteria are:

            <ul>
                <li><span>optic neuritis</span></li>

                Minor criteria include:

            </ul>
            <p>
                In addition, presence of OCBs in the CSF is much less common in persons with NMO than in those 
                with MS, occurring in only about 20% of cases.

                <b>ADEM</b> is clinically characterised by a subacute encephalopathy (altered level of consciousness, 
                behaviour or cognitive function) with MRI showing diffuse brain lesions with variable gadolinium 
                enhancement. In addition, CSF is more likely to show a pleocytosis and elevated total white cell 
                counts and protein levels, and OCBs are less likely to be present in ADEM than in MS. Miller and 
                colleagues<sup>9</sup> proposed a set of diagnostic criteria in which the presence of encephalopathy is 
                required for the diagnosis of ADEM and that recurrence of symptoms may occur within a three-month 
                period but cannot occur after a period of complete remission. It is not that unusual for a patient 
                who was initially diagnosed with ADEM to later develop a classical form of MS, emphasising the spectrum 
                theory.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            <b>Comorbidities</b> may also delay diagnosis. A recent study of medical records from almost 9,000 people with 
            MS showed that the presence of co-morbid conditions – including vascular, autoimmune, musculoskeletal, 
            gastrointestinal, visual or mental comorbidities – may delay the diagnosis of MS anywhere from 1 to 10 
            years. Patients with comorbidities were also found to have a greater level of disability at the time 
            of diagnosis than those who did not<sup>10</sup>.

            In summary, it is important to be aware of differential diagnoses for those who are undergoing 
            investigation for a possible diagnosis of MS, and to be aware that co-morbidities can affect 
            diagnosis as they may mimic or mask indicators of a true diagnosis of MS. Detailed note taking 
            and an accurate patient history are also very important.

            People who present with a first neurological episode of the kind seen in MS, particularly optic 
            neuritis, transverse myelitis or brainstem/cerebellar syndromes, are said to have a 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup3"> ‘clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of MS’</a>. 
            These individuals may or may not fulfil criteria for the diagnosis of MS (as defined in the 
            2010 MacDonald criteria).

            In 2008, an expert panel published a consensus statement which argued that the definition of CIS 
            “ignores first presentations that may not be clinical but may be detected by paraclinical and 
            laboratory findings. CIS, as currently defined, does not discriminate between patients who have 
            a single clinical presentation with or without additional symptomatic lesions on MRI” <sup> 9</sup>. 
            The authors suggested that these are two entities which have different prognoses. The consensus 
            panel recommended a more specific breakdown of CIS into subcategories (see Table 2) to better 
            describe the clinical and radiological findings at the earliest stages of MS. The five types 
            of CIS are listed in Table 2.

            In the longest longitudinal study of patients presenting with CIS, Fisniku and colleagues found that 
            the presence of one or more lesions on the baseline MRI was associated with more than 80% risk of 
            presenting a second attack during a 20-year follow-up period<sup>11</sup>. Up to 21% of patients with no cranial 
            MRI lesions but presenting with a CIS went on to develop a second attack during the follow-up period.

    <h3>2.2.3 Radiology Isolated Syndrome (RIS)</h3>

        <p>
            A new MRI entity that has been described is the so-called ‘radiologically isolated syndrome’ (RIS)<sup>12</sup>. 
            RIS is used to describe the situation in which a patient presents with characteristic MS lesions on a cranial or 
            spinal cord MRI performed for reasons other than the suspicion of MS and in whom no previous history suggestive of a 
            demyelinating episode can be recalled. Studies that followed cohorts of patients with RIS for several years show that 
            approximately one-third subsequently developed clinical attacks<sup>13,14</sup>. A recent study has 
            indicated that clinically silent spinal cord lesions may be an indicator for high risk of progression to 
            MS<sup>15</sup>. However, more studies are needed to confirm/identify factors that might help predict 
            conversion to MS in individuals with RIS.
