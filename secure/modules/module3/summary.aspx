			<ul>     
                <li><span>The diagnosis of MS depends upon a variety of clinical and 
                            paraclinical tests and criteria. </span></li>
                <li><span>Clinical symptoms are essential for a confirmation of MS, but 
                            conditions which are precursors to MS (CIS and RIS) are now being 
                            identified via techniques such as MRI.</span></li>
                <li><span>The complexity of, and time taken for, the diagnosis of MS can be 
                            confusing and distressing to the patient. </span></li>
                <li><span>MS Nurses should explain tests, results and their implications to 
                            enable patients to self-manage during this very challenging time.</span></li>
                <li><span>This will build strong relationships and sustain and support future 
                            care throughout the duration of the MS trajectory.</span></li>
                <li><span>The assessment of disease status and progression will also be 
                            undertaken either following a relapse or at regular follow-up 
                            appointments. </span></li>
                <li><span>Once again, if the MS Nurse is able to take the patient through 
                            the tests and results, and explain the implication of changes 
                            in test scores, then the MS Nurse / patient relationship will 
                            be strengthened, through shared decision making, agreed goals 
                            and mutual trust. This will encourage patient compliance and 
                            communication.</span></li>
                <li><span>Knowing the patient history, comorbidities and disease status is 
                            essential for the provision of optimal patient care. </span></li>
                <li><span>Therapeutic options are discussed in Module 4.
