            3.4 Role of the Multidisciplinary Team (MDT)
        </h2>
    
        <p>
            In most countries, the care and management of people with MS involves a multidisciplinary
            approach<sup>26</sup>. This ensures continuity of care consistent with treatment goals and direction. The
            hub of the comprehensive care team in MS is the knowledgeable patient, supported by family,
            relationship sphere, and care partners. The treatment team may consist of a neurologist and
            other physicians, as well as nurses, social workers, physical therapists, occupational therapists,
            speech language pathologists, recreation therapists, pharmacists, nutritionists, psychologists,
            neuro-psychologists, clergy, and others<sup>19</sup> (figure 2). The overriding objective is to allow people
            with MS to reach their full potential to function independently<sup>17</sup>.

           The MS Nurse functions as the key conduit for  the team, providing information and feedback to team members about the person’s physical, emotional, and cognitive state, and ability to be an active participant in his or her own care. Having identified the person’s needs, the nurse acts to coordinate the necessary interventions, helping to ensure that these needs are adequately addressed<sup>26</sup>. In order to maintain patient trust in the healthcare team’s competence and commitment to the course of treatment, the nurse should ensure that all team members provide patients with consistent reliable information.

        <p>
            It has been found that a multidisciplinary team approach is the most effective and efficient way
            of treating people with MS<sup>20,28</sup>. A multidisciplinary approach to MS care facilitates coordination
            of services and continuity of care, while avoiding duplication and fragmentation for the patient
            and their family. It embraces a philosophy of empowerment – the person with MS is an active
            participant in planning and implementing healthcare and self-care activities. He or she is a
            consultant to the team, which is important because MS, like all chronic illnesses, will last a
            lifetime<sup>20</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ideally, each member of the team should be familiar with patient’s evolving needs and
            circumstances in order to create a realistic treatment programme. This should help the patient
            reach their fullest potential for independent functioning within the context of the life he or she
            chooses to lead. To achieve this, changes may need to be made as the team works with the
            patient, the family network, and, occasionally, within the vocational setting to advocate for
            patients and support their needs and wishes.
