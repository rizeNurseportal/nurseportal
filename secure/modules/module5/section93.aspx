        <h2>9.3 Financial / Vocational</h2>
        <p>
            Financial planning is important at any stage of life and under any circumstances; however, with a chronic illness it becomes the highest priority  if optimal quality of life is to be the aim<sup>156</sup>. MS often strikes working people at the height of their careers; therefore people with MS may be devastated by the prospect and eventual reality of unemployment, with subsequent loss of income. Family or friend caregivers may also face employment reduction as demands of caregiving increase. In both patients and caregivers, productivity is lost due to absenteeism or sick days<sup>157</sup>.

            People with MS may face a restricted range of job opportunities, transportation and 
            architectural barriers, financial disincentives, and limited vocational rehabilitation s
            ervices. Employer perceptions and self-evaluation of work capacity influence the 
            vocational decisions of people with MS, often negatively, because of inadequate or wrong information.

            The    <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1">loss of employment</a>
            brings detrimental consequences to patients and families with respect to short-term 
            and long-term economic, psychosocial and healthcare utilisation<sup>158</sup>. Of those diagnosed 
            with MS for less than 5 years, 67% change job status and 45% switch to a different field<sup>159</sup>. 
            As disability increases, finding a new job becomes more difficult. Approximately 21% of 
            people with MS for less than 5 years are unemployed, versus 92% of those with MS for at 
            least 30 years<sup>159,160</sup>.

            The UK Work Foundation recently published a report looking at employment of people with MS<sup>161</sup>:
            <ul>
                <li><span>On average, 37% of people with mild MS are employed, however, many have to change 
                            or quit their jobs due to fluctuating functional capability;</span></li>
                <li><span>More than 75% of people with MS report that the condition has impacted their 
                            employment and career opportunities;</span></li>
                <li><span>Up to 80% of people with MS stop working within 15 years of the onset of the condition;</span></li>
                <li><span>At the same time 30% of individuals with a significant level of disability 
                            remain in employment;</span></li>
                <li><span>Up to 44% of people with MS retire early due to their condition – compared to the 
                            European average of 35%;</span></li>
                <li><span>People with MS lose an average of 18 working years, assuming a retirement age of 60.</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
            Patients are less likely to be employed when they exhibit global markers of disease severity 
            including physician disability ratings<sup>162</sup>. In addition, unemployment has been associated
            with decreased ambulation and mobility in relation to changes in work status<sup>163,164</sup>, 
            longer disease duration, and a progressive disease course. Specific symptoms such as fatigue, 
            perceived levels of cognitive dysfunction, and poorer performance on neuropsychological tests 
            have also been associated with employment problems in MS. A recent study found that work capacity and HRQoL among individuals diagnosed with MS are highly influenced by fatigue, and also by heat-sensitivity, cognitive difficulties and emotional distress. Significant predictive factors besides fatigue were physical disability (EDSS), age, sex, and level of education. Remaining at work also gives a better HRQoL.<sup>165</sup>

        <p>
            It is important to try to minimise the impact of an MS diagnosis on work/employment if possible. 
            Being in employment has many health benefits and, among other, enables an individual to retain 
            self-esteem, social contacts, financial independence and a valued place in society<sup>1</sup>.

            Within the work environment reasonable adjustments may prevent a premature decision to
            leave a job during a difficult time. Flexible working hours, scheduled work breaks with a place to
            rest, improved awareness of MS amongst colleagues and increased support from employers
            and colleagues may all assist individuals with MS to remain in work.
        </p>

        <p>
            The MS Nurse should usually ask any person with MS specifically if they have problems with
            motor skills, fatigue or cognition which might impact their ability to work. Where possible, such
            difficulties should be assessed by a specialist vocational rehabilitation service which will be able
            to advise the individual on strategies, equipment, adaptations and services available to assist
            with these difficulties. The employer may also benefit from information or advice, with
            permission from the person with MS. In some cases where an individual cannot stay in or find
            alternative employment, they may find voluntary work worthwhile alternative and providing
            information on such options may be useful<sup>1</sup>.

                Statistics show that many MS patients are prematurely retired from work, with two of the most
                important contributing factors being fatigue and cognitive problems. If a problem is identified, it
                is important to work with the person with MS and their employer to try and find a solution to
                enable the person to remain in employment. Some of these solutions might include shorter
                working hours with flexi time; air conditioning to help keep the person cool; allowing the person
                to work from a seated position in a suitable chair to avoid fatigue; modification of duties.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is very important to ensure the employer is educated about the condition and the nurse can
                often assist with this process by providing the employer with the necessary information and
                materials. It is essential that this is done with the patient’s consent - sometimes MS patients
                hide their diagnosis for a number of different reasons. According to my experience, the
                employers are usually very positive, as long as they are informed. The types of information they
                might need include basic information about MS including symptoms, some idea of how the MS
                might progress, and the treatment (medical and other). It is important to describe the nature of
                MS and how the status and symptoms can change from day to day, and even throughout the
                same day (e.g. fatigue).
