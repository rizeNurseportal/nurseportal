            6.2 Screening for Males & Females</h2>

        <p>
            Because MS care is highly specialised, people with MS may focus on managing the neurologic condition whilst neglecting many aspects of basic primary care, including recommended health screenings. Providers, as well as patients, may neglect basic maintenance care. During a neurologic follow-up visit, the focus is often on detecting signs of MS progression, determining whether the patient is administering disease-modifying therapy correctly, and managing any side effects. In the time remaining, there may be little opportunity to explore whether the patient has been keeping up with recommended gynaecologic or cancer screenings<sup>99</sup>.

           A more comprehensive array of screening steps is evolving as more is learned about MS, therapies used and its interactions with body systems<sup>100-102</sup>. Vitamin D levels, herpes virus status, and thyroid function tests are moving to the forefront<sup>99</sup> (figure 7).

            It is important that women with MS should be offered all relevant health screening, for example 
            for cervical and breast cancer<sup>103</sup>. Women should be asked if they are up to date with their 
            screening programmes and are able to access the tests as women with chronic disabling conditions 
            may face substantial barriers that limit health promoting activities critical to a healthy life.
