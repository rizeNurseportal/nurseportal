        <h2>7.2 Pregnancy</h2>
        
        <p>
            The incidence of MS is highest in young women between the ages of 20 to 40 years. This coincides with childbearing years, such that women diagnosed with MS are frequently
            confronted with issues regarding the impact of MS on their capacity to bear children, and the
            potential effects of pregnancy on the course of their MS.

            Women diagnosed with MS are frequently confronted with issues
            regarding the impact of MS on their capacity to bear children, and the potential effects
            of pregnancy on the course of their MS.

        <p>
            Women with MS who wish to become pregnant should not be discouraged. A recent study has
            shown that women who gave birth after the onset of MS took longer to progress to an EDSS
            score of 6 (a disability score that means that patients need some kind of assistance with
            walking; EDSS of 6 specifically refers to use of a cane)<sup>111</sup>.

        <p>
            MS has no physiological effect on fertility<sup>112</sup>. If one parent has MS, the statistical risk of having
            a child with MS is between 3 and 5% (compared with 0.02% in the general Caucasian
            population)<sup>112</sup>. Although risk is increased 30-fold, the actual risk is, however, still low.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of the common MS symptoms such as fatigue, urinary frequency, constipation, and mood
            changes are similar to pregnancy-related symptoms<sup>113</sup>. Disease related (but not specific) issues
            such as fatigue and bladder and bowel problems may require specific consideration in MS; for
            example, a pregnant woman with MS might be more prone to develop urinary tract infections
            consequent to pressure from the foetus on a neurogenic bladder<sup>114</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Pregnancy tends to have a protective effect on MS; the disease process is generally less active
            and relapses less common, especially during the third trimester (figure 8). This protective effect
            is understood to be related to hormonal changes and normal suppression of the immune system
            during pregnancy. However, this protection does not seem to apply to women with progressive
            disease. Discussing this with patients can ease concerns over (temporarily) ceasing
            medications, if this is the selected approach.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the first 3 months postpartum, there is an increased rate of relapse, although no overall
            increase in lifetime relapse rate<sup>115,116</sup>. A two year follow up study determined that birth relapse
            risk is similar to that in the pre-pregnancy year<sup>117</sup>.

            For women with MS who are taking disease modifying treatments, adequate contraception should be 
            used whilst on treatment, as many of the drugs used in the treatment of MS are inadvisable during 
            pregnancy and breastfeeding. Steroids may be used with relative safety in pregnancy<sup>118</sup>. 
            All forms of immunomodulatory therapy should ideally be stopped 1-6 months prior to conception 
            (see individual product information for recommendations); however, information on specific DMTs 
            in pregnancy is available from the manufacturers. As in all pregnancies, all potentially 
            teratrogenic drugs should be avoided; for example, baclofen should be avoided particularly 
            in the first trimester.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is little information regarding effects of MS disease modifying treatments on human male fertility or pregnancy outcomes in fathers receiving treatment. A recent prospective, collaborative study carried out by the MS Study Group of the Italian Neurological Society assessed outcomes of pregnancies fathered by MS patients undergoing DMD. They found no association between paternal DMD exposure at time of conception and risk of spontaneous abortion, adverse fetal outcomes and congenital malformations.<sup>119</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            MS has little or no effect on the course of pregnancy or delivery. Although some studies 
            indicate that women with MS have a slightly increased risk for having small-for-gestational-age 
            newborns<sup>113</sup>, there is no increased risk of miscarriage, foetal malformations, 
            stillbirths, birth defects or infant mortality when the mother has MS.

        <p>
            Decisions regarding management of labour should reflect obstetric issues alone<sup>114</sup>. 
            There is no evidence that either breast feeding or epidural analgesia has any effect on relapse 
            rate or disability<sup>117</sup>. Consideration of breastfeeding should include the 
            physiological and psychological needs of both mother and infant. There is some evidence that 
            breastfeeding might extend the period of relative protection from MS disease activity conferred 
            by the hormonal changes associated with pregnancy<sup>115</sup>.  A recent German study reported significantly reduced postpartum relapse rate during the first 3 months after birth in exclusively breastfeeding mothers compared with nonexclusively breastfeeding or nonbreastfeeding women with MS (p<0.0001).<sup>120</sup> The decision on when to recommence (or commence) immunomodulatory therapy will depend on whether or not a woman is breastfeeding, and her level of disease activity in the postpartum period.

        <p>
            Something that should be considered is the level of disability of the mother and the availability of
            help with the care of the baby, should this be necessary. It is important that the woman
            considers making a birthing plan; a list of family and friends that can be called on should be
            drawn up, as well as the help available from her health visitor, local service provision for
            mothers and support groups locally. Levels of fatigue should also be taken into account, bearing
            in mind that this common symptom can be exacerbated by the pregnancy itself and by
            subsequent disturbed nights.
        </p>
        
        <div class="keypoint">
            MS is unpredictable and therefore decisions about having children
            can be difficult to make. The best that can be done is to support and encourage
            exploration of all the issues, many of which will be uncomfortable, with as much
            knowledge as possible.
        </div>
        <p>Management of MS and decision making surrounding pregnancy are complex subjects. For some time, pregnancy was believed to have a negative effect on MS, and while this has not been supported by evidence, women with MS can experience negative attitudes about pregnancy and MS from their healthcare providers, Results from a small recent study suggest that healthcare providers do not discourage pregnancy for women with MS, recommend that women not use DMTs while pregnant, and have a positive view of breastfeeding. The results of this study do highlight a need for evidence-based recommendations related to the effect of DMT on pregnancy and breastfeeding, as well as the need for better guidelines on MS management related to family planning, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.<sup>122</sup></p>
