        <h2>9.6 Family / Relationships / Parenting and MS</h2>
        <p>
            From the time of diagnosis, MS can affect the life cycle of the entire family, 
            compounding and confusing the normal transitions and stresses of everyday living. 
            Patients may be confronted with considerable alterations in their social environments 
            due to MS. In some cases, unmarried patients are forced to return to their family 
            homes, and both patients and their parents and siblings must adapt to this frequently 
            stressful situation.

        <p>
            Having a parent with MS may have  negative psychosocial effects, and long-term impacts on subsequent life chances and health, on children and adolescents of the parent, but there is a lack of consensus (positive aspects have also been found).<sup>167</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            Family members (including any children) living in the same house as a person with MS, 
            and family members delivering substantial help (even if living elsewhere), can be 
            supported through some simple measures. Firstly, asking about their physical and 
            emotional health and well-being, especially in the case of children aged 16 years 
            or less, and offering advice and referring on for additional support if necessary. 
            It can also be helpful to provide general factual information about MS, but it is 
            important to obtain permission from the person with MS before providing information 
            on issues related specifically to that person. The MS Nurse should confirm that the 
            carer is able to provide support for personal activities of daily living (such as 
            dressing and toileting), and that they are safe and competent at such tasks, and 
            that the person with MS is happy for them to provide such assistance. Where applicable, 
            carers should be informed about services and benefits that might be available to them<sup>1</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cumulative disability can interfere with the performance of a person’s roles within the 
            family. For example, a primary earner may need to give up working; a parent may need help 
            with childcare activities; a homemaker may be unable to manage household tasks. As with 
            every other loss brought about by MS, these major life changes need to be mourned before 
            the individual and family can begin to make constructive adaptations. It is important to assess and treat families as a dynamic unit in order to assure comprehensive intervention plans.<sup>168</sup>

            The turmoil of emotions which may occur in response to the onset of disability, impacts 
            upon the partner and may alter their need for autonomy and intimacy. A change in roles 
            within a relationship from an equal partnership to one of ‘carer’ and ‘cared for’ substantially 
            alters the dynamics of the relationship. In addition the effects of cognitive 
            changes on the relationship may need to be addressed. Some couples may adjust and adapt to 
            a new type of relationship but others may experience difficulty. Identified risk factors 
            within relationships are the presence of a progressive condition, marriages begun before 
            the onset of disability and the presence of a sexual dysfunction<sup>169-172</sup> . The 
            importance of intimacy and communication within couples is vital as people often have 
            difficulty talking about problems with each other.
        </p>

        <p>
            For those people with MS who care for their children at home, the stress, guilt, and fatigue these
            people experience while keeping up with the physical and emotional demands of a young child
            or children can be particularly difficult to endure. Developing support systems and backup plans
            for when these patients may need extra rest or childcare assistance can help them manage
            their child-related responsibilities<sup>173.</sup>.

                What might be the needs of the family and others when
                someone is diagnosed or living with MS and what might you do to support and
                inform them?
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="nursetippopup1" class="nursetippopup">
            <p>
                The family has similar needs to the person with MS and typically requires information about the
                condition. A child may have a fear of a parent dying, or be worried that they might catch MS.
                Adolescents can be fearful that their parent is going to be an embarrassment to them. All these
                fears and questions need to be addressed and appropriate support given to family members.
                The family need assurance that it is normal to feel angry or frightened or unsure of how they are
                reacting to the diagnosis; MS is a family affair. The family can benefit from special family
                adaptation courses; these usually take place over a weekend or are evening based, e.g. 3-4
                evenings.

            Family issues are often overlooked during the nursing assessment as patients may find it
            difficult to discuss these issues. Many patients do not feel comfortable sharing the concerns
            they may have about the impact of MS on their social and personal lives. The impact of MS on
            emotional status and family relationships therefore often goes unrecognised and untreated.

            The MS Nurse plays a significant role in ensuring both patients and their families remain
            positive throughout the lifestyle accommodations and adjustments that may be needed
            throughout the disease process. They can help facilitate individual and family adjustment to the
            illness.
