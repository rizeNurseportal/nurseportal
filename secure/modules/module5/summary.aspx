                <li><span>People with MS are at an increased risk for osteoporosis; those individuals should be identified early, and preventive treatment initiated to avoid bone loss and fractures</span></li>

                <li><span>There is no reason why a woman with MS should be deterred from becoming pregnant if she wishes, although she should be advised that the risk of relapse decreases during pregnancy, and increases temporarily post-partum. </span></li>

                <li><span>Every person (or couple) with MS should be asked sensitively about, or given the opportunity to remark upon, any difficulties they may be having in establishing and/or maintaining sexual and personal relationships</span></li>
                <li><span>It is important for the person with MS to make the most of their physical and emotional wellbeing to enable them to live life to the fullest</span></li>
                <li><span>Eating healthily and exercising regularly can help maintain a healthy weight, preserve muscle strength and flexibility, minimise fatigue and improve mood</span></li>

                <li><span>MS can affect the life cycle of the entire family, compounding and confusing the normal transitions and stresses of everyday living</span></li>
                <li><span>The role of the MS Nurse is critical to successful long-term management and outcomes in MS. </span></li>
                <li><span>The MS Nurse can deliver positive outcomes to all affected by a diagnosis of MS, using elements of care and support that differ from the other health and social care professionals who may be involved in care.</span></li>
