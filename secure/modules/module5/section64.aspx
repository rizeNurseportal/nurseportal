        <h2>6.4 Role of the MS Nurse</h2>

        <p>
            The nurse’s role in primary care of MS can involve the following<sup>18</sup>:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span>Identifying and addressing the patient’s primary care needs along a continuum of health and well-being</span></li>
            <li><span>Recognising and assessing (but not necessarily treating) the patient’s symptoms and
                        non-MS related conditions</span></li>
            <li><span>Referring the patient to appropriate providers</span></li>
            <li><span>Assessing outcomes, including adherence to recommendations, during subsequent
                        visits</span></li>
            <li><span>Educating the patient and other healthcare providers about primary care needs within
                        the context of MS</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The nurse can help to advocate for the patient with primary care providers, identify providers
            and diagnostic facilities that can accommodate patients with neurologic disease (such as a
            facility that can manage mammography in a patient with physical impairments), or find
            resources within the neurology practice or MS centre to address health concerns beyond those
            directly related to the disease<sup>99</sup>.
        </p>
