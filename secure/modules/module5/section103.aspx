        <h2>10.3 The Role of the MS Nurse within the Multidisciplinary Team</h2>

        <p>
            The MS Nurse has emerged as a pivotal member of a multidisciplinary team who provides
            education, skills development, and healthcare delivery for patients with MS and their families.
            MS Nurses now treat patients in primary, acute, specialised, and rehabilitative settings. MS
            Nurses are educators and advocates. Some have prescription privileges, and most work closely
            with the patient in monitoring and assessing treatment outcomes. MS Nurses often initiate,
            coordinate, or contribute to clinical research.
        </p>

        <p>
            In many respects, the nurse functions as the eyes and ears of the team, providing information
            and feedback to team members about the person’s physical, emotional, and cognitive state, and
            ability to be an active participant in his or her own care. Having identified the person’s needs,
            the nurse acts to coordinate the necessary interventions, thus helping to ensure that the identified 
            needs are adequately addressed<sup>22</sup>. They often must act as liaisons between patients and 
            other members of the multidisciplinary team involved in the care of patients with MS 
            (ie neurologist, family physician, pharmacist, physiotherapist, etc). Therefore, in order 
            to maintain patient trust in the healthcare team’s competence and commitment to the course 
            of treatment, nurses should ensure that all team members provide patients with consistent 
            reliable information.
