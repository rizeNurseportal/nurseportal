                <li><span>Pregnancy is safe in most women with MS and does not negatively influence the overall
                            MS disease course.</span></li>
                <li><span>Use of disease-modifying treatments around conception should be considered on a
                            case-by-case basis, weighing risks of drug exposure against risks of relapses.</span></li>
                <li><span>There is no reason why a woman with MS should be deterred from becoming pregnant if
                            she wishes, although she should be advised that the risk of relapse decreases during
                            pregnancy, and increases temporarily post-partum.</span></li>
                <li><span>When giving birth, women with MS should have the analgesia that seems most
                            appropriate and acceptable to them, without fear of it affecting their MS.</span></li>
