            <p>
                Rapid advances in technology and medications used for MS, and an increased
                emphasis on home care and patient self-care, challenge nurses to face increasingly diverse
                responsibilities in caring for patients with MS. Nurses not only must help meet the healthcare
                requirements of these patients but often must also serve as the hub of communication,
                education, advocacy, and counselling for patients, their families or care partners, and other
                healthcare professionals.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the health professional with most frequent contact with patients, the MS Nurse often serves
                as the management hub — identifying medical, psychological, and social issues, making
                referrals, acting as patient advocate and/ or care manager, and fostering communication among
                the clinicians involved, and between the clinicians and the patient and family. Therefore the
                Nurse has a crucial role to play throughout the disease course.
