        <h2>9.8 End of Life</h2>

        <p>
            MS is a complex and often fluctuating condition. It is impossible to predict how a 
            person with MS will be affected over time and each person will have their own 
            experience of living with MS. The majority of people diagnosed with MS can look 
            forward to many years of near normal activity but it is important that people 
            with MS are given the opportunity to discuss their wishes relating to their 
            care needs early on in the course of the condition. “Will I die from MS?” is 
            not an unusual question from one faced with this diagnosis.

            What are my own feelings about end of life? How do they influence my behaviour when caring for people with MS?

            End of life care is less about the very end of life and more about the specific needs 
            along the whole care pathway. The supportive and palliative care needs that it entails 
            will be required in the last year or two of life for some, but for others these needs 
            may come and go throughout the whole pathway.

            Advance care planning can be used to set out a person’s preferences and wishes in relation to their future care. This may encompass any wishes relating to end of life care. Lasting powers of attorney can also be granted so that a relative or friend can make decisions relating to property, financial affairs and personal welfare on a person’s behalf should they lose the capacity to do so themselves. A new approach to caring for dying people based on the needs and wishes of the person and those close to them has recently been launched in the UK. It takes the form of five new Priorities for Care. This new approach focusses on giving compassionate care and is a move away from previous processes and protocols. It recognises that in many cases, enabling the individual to plan for death should start well before a person reaches the end of their life and should be an integral part of personalised and proactive care.

            The MS Nurse should support increased openness and discussion about care preferences and
            end of life care issues, so that people with MS are made aware of the range of support and
            services that are available to them. This is a particularly important issue to consider given the
            cognition and communication problems that may present in the later stages of the disease
            trajectory for people with MS. An honest discussion about progression and end of life choices,
            along with timely referrals to and collaboration with comprehensive palliative care or hospice
            services, can return to the patient a sense of hope for whatever amount of time is remaining, be
            it months or many more years.
