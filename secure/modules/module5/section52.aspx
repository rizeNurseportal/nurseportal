            During initial consultations with the person with MS, it is important that the MS Nurse completes
            a comprehensive review of physical and emotional symptoms.<a href="../module2/section31.aspx" target="_blank"> (see module 2 for detailed definitions of some of these symptoms)</a>. Information should be 
            sought on the effects of MS on mobility, vocational ability, the need for aids or adaptations and
            the availability of personal support. It is important for the MS Nurse to look beyond the
            perceived need of an individual to their actual need.
