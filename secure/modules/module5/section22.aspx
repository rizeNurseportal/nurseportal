        <h2>2.2  Building a Relationship of Trust with the Person with MS</h2>
		
		<p>
			Appropriate communications with the person with MS are vital for establishing a trusting relationship. Good communication may;
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span>Improve satisfaction and adherence with treatment plans/decisions</span></li>
			<li><span>Improve health outcomes (eg reduction in blood pressure, improved recovery from infection)</span></li>
            <li><span>Ensure time and opportunity for concerns to be voiced, heard and addressed</span></li>
		</ul>
        <p>
           A number of studies looking at the experience of people with MS suggest they often feel professionals have an inappropriate attitude towards them, and that they feel deprived of the information and support they need<sup>1</sup>. In addition, there may also be discrepancies in perception between what the person with MS feels are their healthcare needs and what the professional perceives their needs to be<sup>1,2</sup>.

           The quality of the interaction between patients and healthcare professionals is an important factor in determining patient satisfaction.  Dissatisfaction may occur as a result of poor communication. Nursing experience suggests that those healthcare professionals who demonstrate insightful awareness of patients’ verbal and nonverbal communication needs, and are empathic to patients’ feelings, facilitate patient satisfaction.

           Information sharing is a challenging part of a consultation, and the more information that has to be communicated, the harder it is to assess how it is perceived or understood. Patients typically only retain 50% of the information given to them during a consultation – however, effective and timely communication may help to increase the amount of key information that a patient takes away.

        <p>
            The MS Nurse should first establish the person’s pre-existing knowledge, beliefs and
            experience with MS. Then the MS Nurse should consider the type and extent of information that
            the person wishes to receive and when. The MS Nurse should consider carefully the balance
            between the potential benefits and risks associated with all information, together with individual
            internal contextual factors such as cognitive ability and external contextual factors such as
            cultural and ethnic influences<sup>1</sup>.

                How would you begin to identify the pre-existing knowledge of someone who has just
                been diagnosed with MS?

               I ask the person with MS how they received their diagnosis and how did it make them feel at that time? - This should normally happen in a face to face meeting with the doctor, but there have been cases where the person has received their diagnosis via a telephone conversation or by letter. I then ask the person what they already know about MS and where they got this information from. I also ask them if there are any specific questions they want to ask me. Asking these questions is a good starting point for discussion and enables me to find out the level and quality of information that the person already has.

            Guidelines recommend that the information the MS Nurse provides is within their own area of
            knowledge/expertise and refers patients to others when necessary. It is important to clarify any
            specific options and choices the person with MS may need to make and the likely outcomes of
            each choice, with benefits and risks fully explained. It is essential to provide supporting
            written/audio material, web links, contact details, support groups, statutory advisory addresses,
            treatment plans and follow-up appointments<sup>1</sup>.

        <p>
            MS Nurses should also consider that many people with MS have depression, impairment of cognitive skills and/or visual impairment that can impact on processing of information. Therefore the delivery and information communication is  as important as the content. Tips include:
        </p>
		<ul>
			<li><span>Use different types of questions (open, closed, focused) appropriately</span></li>
			<li><span>Active listening – pick up on verbal and nonverbal behaviour</span></li>
            <li><span>Give information in small portions, avoiding medical jargon</span></li>
            <li><span>Use a logical sequence</span></li>
            <li><span>Use diagrams and written materials to help explain the information</span></li>
            <li><span>Summarise and check regularly to ensure that both parties have communicated
                        effectively</span></li>
            <li><span>Let the person ask, or ask him/her: what is the main issue in your mind right now?</span></li>
            <li><span>Be aware of fatigue and anxiety when giving new information; it may not be wise to
                        give all materials during the first session</span></li>
            <li><span>Pace information carefully and always provide an opportunity for review and repetition</span></li>
		</ul>
        <p>
            There are a number of challenges to effective communication that the MS Nurse might encounter:
        </p>
		<ul>
			<li><span>Telephone conversations: there are no non-verbal cues, therefore it is important 
                        to check the person can hear and understand; speak clearly and avoid using long sentences; 
                        check and summarise regularly to ensure that you have heard the person’s story correctly and 
                        that they understand the information you have given them correctly; make sure you give 
                        enough time for the information to be heard and offer follow-up phone 
                        calls as necessary</span></li>
			<li><span>Listen to what is called the “sub text” and this means getting a feeling for what 
                        the person is not able to say outright but would like to be able to do so</span></li>
            <li><span>In some unfortunate occasions, the patient may even get the diagnosis by phone, which should not happen</span></li>
		</ul>
        <p>When patients are faced with a complex array of treatment options, they have described six common themes they experience during the decision making process. These are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span>
                    weighing up and deciding what's important 
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                   acknowledging the illness as part of oneself
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                   playing the mental game
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                   seeking credible resources
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                   evaluating symptoms and fit with quality of life
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span>
                  managing the roles and involvement of family.
                </span>
            </li>


        </ul>
        <p>These provide a greater understanding about the experience of making a therapeutic choice for people with MS and offer insights for nurses when supporting and communicating with patients faced with options about treatment.<sup>3</sup></p>
        <p>
            Establishing care is the first step toward building relationships and encouraging open 
            communication with people with MS and their families or care partners. Components of 
            establishing care include:
        </p>
		<ul>
			<li><span>Building trust</span></li>
			<li><span>Establishing partnerships</span></li>
            <li><span>Determining information needs</span></li>
            <li><span>Sharing information</span></li>
            <li><span>Assessing the individuals support network</span></li>
		</ul>
