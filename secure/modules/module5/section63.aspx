        <h2>6.3 Osteoporosis</h2>

        <p>
            Osteoporosis is a condition of impaired bone strength which leads to increased risk of fracture. 
            People with MS are at a higher risk for osteoporosis than the general population<sup>104</sup>. 
            Reasons for this elevated risk include their impaired mobility, reduced levels of weight-bearing 
            activity, low vitamin D levels, and the use of corticosteroids for MS treatment<sup>105</sup>. 
            Although osteoporosis risk is considerably higher among women regardless of comorbid diseases, 
            the presence of MS heightens osteoporosis risk for men as well<sup>106</sup>.

        <p>
            Because osteoporosis rates in MS are not in proportion to the person’s age and ambulation level, 
            there may be a pathological connection between MS and early bone loss<sup>106</sup>. People with 
            MS have a high risk for <a href="#" rel="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdive">fractures</a>
            due to falls, and osteoporosis significantly increases this risk.

           Marrie and colleagues used the NARCOMS database to examine rates of osteoporotic fractures among people with MS<sup>104</sup>. Among a sample of 9,346 people with MS, 25% reported having osteopenia or osteoporosis, and approximately 16% reported a history of fracture. Of these, 35% were wrist fractures, 11% were vertebral fractures, 7% were hip fractures, and over 42% reported multiple fractures<sup>105</sup>. In a nationwide sample of 20 years of hospital admissions in the USA, the prevalence of MS in the population with hip fracture was greater than twice that predicted, and MS patients suffered an acute fracture at an earlier age.<sup>107</sup>

        <p>
            Bone density screening and supplementation with calcium and vitamin D have been shown to
            be substandard among people with MS and thus represent interventions that should be
            increased among those with MS<sup>104</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Prevention is more effective than treatment of established osteoporosis. For all patients,
            nonpharmacological therapies should be considered for prevention of skeletal fragility, including
            adequate weight-bearing exercise, nutrition (protein, calcium, vitamin D), and lifestyle
            modifications. Disability is the most often cause of bone loss in patients with MS, and
            mechanical loading and exercise interventions can prevent osteocyte apoptosis and bone
            loss<sup>108,109</sup>.

        <p>
            There are currently no specific recommendations in people with MS regarding diagnosis of
            osteoporosis or therapeutic interventions; however, identification and treatment of any
            underlying cause should be the goal of therapeutic management. Optimally, individuals at
            higher risk of osteoporosis should be identified early, and preventive treatment initiated to avoid
            the bone loss and fractures<sup>110</sup>.
