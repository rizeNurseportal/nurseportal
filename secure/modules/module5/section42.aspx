                MS can cause emotional distress in many ways; people may experience fear, anger,
                denial, anxiety, depression, and hopelessness. These emotions may hinder motivation to take
                medications or perform complicated tasks designed to improve their well-being.

            MS may start at a young age, at a time when individuals are developing expectations for their
            future. Furthermore, the course of the disease is unpredictable and causes a great deal of
            uncertainty<sup>1</sup>. Many people have negative misconceptions about MS and their expectations may
            often be worse than the reality. There is no doubt that MS can lead to several cumulative losses
            over many years, resulting in feelings of loss of control. In addition, MS also affects family
            members, and the changing interactions between family members can also increase emotional
            distress<sup>1</sup>.

            Psychosocial support is a major category of treatment in MS, encompassing:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Disease-related education (more recently termed psychoeducation — a supportive
                educational process designed to enhance people’s understanding of the disease,
                adaptive coping strategies, and available resources)</span></li>
            <li><span>Diagnosis/treatment of emotional and/or cognitive problems</span></li>
            <li><span>Family interventions designed to support family members’ efforts to cope with the
                intrusion of MS into the household</span></li>
            <li><span>Support for people’s efforts to remain productively employed as long as they are able
                and interested, and to transition out of the workforce when, and if, it is necessary to do
                so</span></li>
            <li><span>Helping people with MS and their families to access available resources</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            A study of people with MS and their satisfaction with care showed that the majority perceived a
            need for psychosocial support/counselling, with women experiencing a greater need for such
            services than men. However, the provision of this psychosocial support was one of the things
            the study participants were least satisfied with<sup>29</sup>.

            The provision of emotional support is still very much under debate. The NCCCC found limited
            evidence for the effectiveness of psychotherapy and no research into its cost-effectiveness<sup>1</sup>.
            However they do acknowledge that a person with MS may benefit from emotional support, and
            recommend that this is considered on an individual basis<sup>1</sup>.
