        <h2>5.7 Speech and Swallowing</h2>
    
        <p>
            Dysarthria and dysphagia may or may not occur at the same time. The speech and language pathologist 
            specialises in evaluating and treating speech, communication, cognitive, and swallowing problems. 
            Dysphagia evaluation may include videofluoroscopic or barium swallow studies to track the movement of 
            food during swallowing. Treatment is rehabilitative and educational. Changing the head or body 
            position during eating may relieve the symptom. Eating smaller quantities at any one time may reduce 
            fatigue and choking.
