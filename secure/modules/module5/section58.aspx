         <p>
            The assessment and management of spasticity requires expertise, and the involvement of a 
            multidisciplinary team. Treatment is primarily physical, and supplemented by pharmacological 
            treatments, which can be systemic or focal. Management strategies should be goal directed, 
            and targeted to the needs of the individual.

        <p>
            Two core principles of spasticity management are:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><span>Optimising an individual’s posture and movement through use of appropriate seating, 
                        stretching and exercise programmes<sup>83</sup>.</span></li>
            <li><span>Preventing or managing factors that may increase spasticity and spasms (see below).
                These procedures are paramount in the management of spasticity irrespective of other 
                treatment options used<sup>83</sup>.      </span>
            </li>
        </ol>
                        
                <ul>
                    <li><span><b><i>Optimising bladder and bowel management:</i></b> Any change, such as urinary 
                            retention or infection, constipation or diarrhoea, can trigger an increase in spasms. 
                            Resolving these issues is important before considering changing other aspects of 
                            spasticity management such as drug regimes.</span></li>
                    <li><span><b><i>Maintaining skin integrity:</i></b> Preventing skin irritation, breakdown, infection 
                            and pressure sores minimises the risk of triggering spasticity.</span></li>
                    <li><span><b><i>Maximising hygiene:</i></b> Good hygiene not only promotes healthy skin but also 
                            identifies other spasticity trigger factors such as ingrown toenails, deep vein 
                            thrombosis (DVT) or tight fitting clothes or orthoses<sup>84</sup>.<span></li>
                </ul>  

        <p>
            Painful spasms can be managed with stretching, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) 
            and application of cold compresses<sup>85</sup>; however, evidence to support cold applications for treatment 
            of spasticity is unclear. <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1">Skilled rehabilitation 
            strategies are recommended for both focal and generalised spasticity</a>.
        </p>

        <div id="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdivepopup">
            <p>
                Tightness and muscle shortening can be addressed with prolonged stretching, range-of-motion 
                exercise, and posture and positioning changes. Range-of-motion exercise may also improve joint 
                mobility and reduce the risk of joint contracture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Management of weakness includes strengthening exercises and, where necessary, use of braces, 
                splints, orthotics, and mobility aids. Exercises should be done in a cool environment and with 
                attention to avoiding muscle fatigue. Biofeedback may help relieve hypertonicity and concurrent 
                contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles. Relaxation may help with hypertonicity, and 
                balance/coordination activities and timing exercises may help with co-contractions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            These principles need to be regularly considered and reviewed over time and used in conjunction 
            with medical treatments. Pivotal to their success is ongoing multidisciplinary teamwork across 
            hospital and community settings working collaboratively with the person with spasticity to 
            effectively manage their symptoms<sup>83,86</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            A spasticity management programme works if the person is able to successfully implement it. 
            Individual habits and preferences, such as the person’s ability or desire to stretch regularly, 
            can make or break a programme. At the same time, factors related to MS such as cognitive changes 
            (difficulties with attention, concentration, comprehension, and recall), limited mobility, 
            fatigue, or depression can make it very difficult for even a highly motivated person to commit 
            to a treatment programme<sup>87</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            MS Nurses have a significant role in educating a person on managing trigger factors and the available treatments to manage spasticity. They can provide ongoing support and advice to
            a person and their family as they live with, and adjust to, managing spasticity and spasms over
            time. In the context of spasticity, MS nurses may have any of the following roles, which will be
            dependent on their working environment:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span>Recognition when spasticity becomes problematic, and initiating referral to
                community-based therapists/neurorehabilitation team</span></li>
            <li><span>Education about spasticity triggers such as tight clothing</span></li>
            <li><span>Provision and reinforcement of advice in spasticity management to patients</span></li>
            <li><span>In some teams, the nurse may be able to prescribe systemic treatments</span></li>
            <li><span>Assisting in the prevention and management of the complications of spasticity as
                part of the multidisciplinary team</span></li>
        </ul>

           A person with MS who experiences reduced mobility must be assessed, y by a rehabilitation service. It is important to identify and treat any underlying impairment: especially weakness, fatigue, spasticity, ataxia, sensory loss and loss of confidence. Rehabilitation usually involves task-related, or goal focused, practice of activity or activities (for example, walking, transferring, using a wheelchair, climbing stairs). It may be possible to provide suitable equipment, including wheelchairs, driving equipment and adaptive technology (with training in its use). In addition, alterations to the environment may be possible, which will help maintain the individual’s independence. It is also valuable to teach family carers how to safely assist with (or take over) tasks in support of everyday living<sup>86</sup>.
