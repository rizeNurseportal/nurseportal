        <h2>9.2 Living a Healthier Life</h2>

        <p>
            Health promotion activities encompass a number of self-initiated health behaviours and
            emphasise the need to enhance each person’s responsibility and commitment to a healthy
            lifestyle. A variety of health promoting behaviours such as physical activity, stress management,
            healthy eating, and building supportive interpersonal relationships can contribute significantly to
            the person’s perceived health, functional status, and quality of life<sup>103</sup> and are reflected in the list
            of leading health indicators proposed in Healthy People 2010<sup>137</sup>. A growing body of literature
            also provides supportive evidence of the positive impact of health promotion/wellness
            interventions for persons with chronic and disabling conditions<sup>138</sup>.

            Good nutritional planning is important in maintaining health in people with MS. However, no dietary supplement or elimination of certain foods has been proven to have an effect on the disease course, despite some claims to the contrary. Poor nutrition can make a patient prone to infection or complications, and fibre and fluid intake can have an impact on constipation, which is a common complaint in MS. Weight control is important in managing both MS and the person’s overall health<sup>137</sup>. Fatty fish intake might decrease the risk for MS. A hypothetical explanation is that intake of fatty fish may compensate for vitamin D deficiency that is associated with increased MS risk.<sup>139</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Results from 2 recent case-control studies suggest that drinking alcohol appears to have a protective effect on the risk of developing MS.<sup>140</sup> A dose-dependent inverse association was found between alcohol consumption and risk of developing MS that was statistically significant in both sexes. These findings give no support to advising patients with MS to completely refrain from alcohol consumption. The protective effect of alcohol was greater in smokers.

          Exercise is also an important component in MS wellness and is thought to help people control pain, stiffness, balance, weakness, depression, anxiety, insomnia and fatigue when done appropriately. Some activities such as yoga, T’ai chi, walking, and swimming are thought to be especially beneficial<sup>141</sup>. A systematic review found exercise training was not associated with an increased risk of relapse, and risk of adverse events was not higher than in healthy populations. This evidence should alleviate uncertainty regarding the safety of exercise training in MS.<sup>142</sup>

        <h3>9.2.3 Smoking</h3>
        <p>
            Although it is well known that smoking is detrimental to everyone’s health, it has also been associated with an increased risk of MS<sup>143</sup>. In a study of 22,312 people between the ages of 40 and 47, the risk for developing MS was nearly twice as high in people who currently smoked or had ever smoked as in non-smokers. When men and women were evaluated separately, the risk for developing MS was nearly three times greater for men and one and a half times greater for women who smoked than in non-smokers. A recent meta-analysis concluded that smoking is a significant risk factor for subsequent development of MS<sup>144</sup>. Smoking has been found to increase the risk of MS in a dose response manner and affects MS risk regardless of age at exposure<sup>145</sup>. Further studies suggest that smoking may be a risk factor for transforming a relapsing-remitting clinical course into a secondary progressive course<sup>146-148</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, children exposed to parental smoking at home have been found to have a higher
            risk of childhood-onset MS<sup>149</sup>. Further studies are needed to investigate the effects of smoking
            and MS. In addition, reverse causality should be considered, as MS onset or MS symptoms
            might influence smoking habits<sup>150</sup>.
        </p>

        <a id="4" name="4"></a>
        <h3>9.2.4 Vitamin D</h3>
        <p>
            Vitamin D has several important roles in the body including regulating immune responses. Its possible role in MS remains the focus of much debate and research. There is some evidence that links risk of disease development and disease course to the serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D which is the biologically inactive storage form of vitamin D. Increased sun exposure during childhood has been consistently shown to decrease the risk of MS<sup>151</sup>. Several epidemiological studies have also provided a direct correlation between vitamin D intake and vitamin D serum levels with both the risk for new disease development and the course of already established MS<sup>152,153</sup>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Vitamin D supplementation in healthy individuals is emerging as an approach to  MS prevention; however evidence supporting a therapeutic effect of vitamin D in modifying the course of MS is less compelling<sup>154</sup>. Studies are currently underway, or in the planning stages, to look at the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in people with MS, to establish the safety of high doses (up to 40,000 IU/day) of vitamin D in MS, and to assess the effects of supplementation on the immune system and on the skeleton. Results from a recent 5-year prospective study demonstrated that people with low levels of vitamin D and early signs of MS get worse faster than people with higher vitamin D levels.<sup>155</sup> MS patients with high blood levels of vitamin D had a 57% lower rate of new brain lesions, a 57% lower relapse rate, and a 25% lower yearly increase in lesion volume compared to those with the lowest levels of vitamin D. However, it is not clear if insufficient vitamin D itself causes a more aggressive disease course or if low levels of vitamin D are only a biomarker, not the cause.
