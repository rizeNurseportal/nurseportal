        <h2>5.10 Pain / Sensation</h2>
    
        <p>
            Pain is a complex, multidimensional phenomenon. It is an unpleasant experience, particularly 
            when combined with the other symptoms of MS. It impacts upon many aspects of an individual’s 
            psychosocial and spiritual well-being and can be difficult for the individual to cope with.

            Pain is an unpleasant experience, particularly when combined with the other symptoms of MS. 
            It impacts upon many aspects of an individual’s psychosocial and spiritual well-being and 
            can be difficult for the individual to cope with.

        <p>
            Undiagnosed or sub therapeutically managed clinical depression, loss of sleep, mobility problems, 
            financial insecurity, feelings of low self-esteem, all result in people finding it hard to manage 
            their pain. This must be considered when developing pain management strategies for people with 
            MS. Pain intensity has been shown to be related to levels of fatigue and depression and impacts 
            patients' QoL, limiting both their daily activities and their working life<sup>89</sup>. The importance of 
            developing coping strategies is paramount and these can include relaxation, distraction, exercise 
            regimes and the use of therapies that can be self-administered such as TENS and massage.
        </p>

        <p>
           People with MS can experience pain due to problems other than MS, so other  factors such as concurrent arthritis, rheumatism, previous injuries and surgery must be considered. Acknowledging that the pain is real is validating for some people with MS, particularly when many of them will have been told, sometimes by health professionals, that MS is not associated with pain. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When a person with MS presents with pain he/she should be assessed to identify the cause. This, along 
            with impact on QOL and functioning, should be taken into consideration when devising a treatment plan 
            (table 9 and 10). If pain remains unresolved it is advisable to refer them onto a specialist 
            multidisciplinary pain team, if possible<sup>90</sup>.

            A thorough clinical and neurological examination is required and the use of a pain diary is 
            recommended to document triggers, intensity, concomitant features, duration and pain-relief 
            methods employed. Several studies have shown that visual analogue scales are the most 
            appropriate method for recording pain severity (figure 5).<sup>91-93</sup>

        <p>
            To effectively manage MS pain a detailed evaluation is essential (table 9 and 10). Information 
            required includes exploring previous pain experiences, the person’s pain symptoms, onset, duration, 
            frequency, location, the severity, its characteristics, relieving strategies and the impact
            on daily living activities. Anxiety, fear and depression do not necessarily increase the pain 
            experience; however it does affect an individual’s reaction to pain.
