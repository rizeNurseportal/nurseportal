        <h2>9.7 Cultural & Ethnic Considerations</h2>

        <p>
            The patient population is not homogeneous and MS Nurses will see people from a wide variety of settings and cultural backgrounds. People from different countries/ethnic background will have a different understanding of MS and/or may be frightened by it. It may be difficult to deal with cultural diversity and varying health literacy, especially with those who are not using their first language to communicate with their nurse.
        </p>

        <p>
           Try to involve others in their family network, work network, or, religious network. It is important that two “sets of ears” listen to what is being said. Ask the patient and significant others to relay back what has just been said, to make sure they understand the terms that have been used and the procedures they have been asked to do—and to make sure it is all acceptable to their culture. Even with patients whose families have been here for generations, it is important to be careful about cultural norms.

            Culture is defined as learned beliefs, values, behaviours, attitudes and customs, shared by a group. 
            Cultural competence is defined as understanding biological variations and effects of medications and 
            disease processes in different ethnic groups. Purnell developed the Purnell model for cultural 
            competence with the following precepts<sup>174</sup>:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span>All cultures share similarities</span></li>
            <li><span>One culture is not better; they are just different</span></li>
            <li><span>Cultures change slowly over time</span></li>
            <li><span>Difference exists within, between and among cultures</span></li>
            <li><span>Culture has a powerful influence on patients’ reactions to illness and interactions 
                        with the healthcare system</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Easterling has described a model that recognises cultural diversity in MS that has been described as 
            the transcultural assessment model. Principles implicit in this model include that the MS Nurse:
        </p>

        
        <ul>
            <li><span>Recognises every individual as unique</span></li>
            <li><span>Identifies literacy level and those “at risk”</span></li>
            <li><span>Identifies cultural health practices and beliefs</span></li>
            <li><span>Plans culturally based learning experiences</span></li>
            <li><span>Uses materials using different languages when appropriate</span></li>
            <li><span>Uses visual aids</span></li>
            <li><span>Uses concrete rather than abstract words</span></li>
            <li><span>Invites questions</span></li>
            <li><span>Avoids the use of complex medical terminology when possible</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Nursing strategies include that the nurse must validate brief information in writing 
            and use humour cautiously. The MS Nurse should avoid the use of slang words. It is 
            important to include the family, when possible, in planning and learning sessions<sup>175</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Successful individualised treatment of different cultural groups in MS calls for the 
            MS Nurse to have ongoing self-awareness, knowledge, and sensitivity about differences, 
            accepting and respecting those differences, resisting judgmental attitudes and being 
            open and comfortable with cultural encounters<sup>176</sup>.
