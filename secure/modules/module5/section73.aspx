        <h2>7.3 Impact of Menstrual Cycle and Menopause on Relapse / MS Symptoms</h2>

        <p>
            Many women have reported cyclical changes in MS symptoms and feel that their symptoms deteriorate two to three days prior to the onset 
            of their period and improve once bleeding has started. A few small studies have confirmed this anecdotal evidence<sup>123-125</sup>. 
            In another small study, it was found that 78% of women had premenstrual worsening of their MS symptoms in one or more of the menstrual 
            cycles analysed<sup>126</sup>.

        <p>
           Symptoms that may increase premenstrually are  arm and leg weakness, pain and nocturia. A greater understanding of this ‘menstrual cycle effect’ would help to reduce anxiety associated with an unexpected increase of symptoms. Current data suggest that premenstrual symptoms alone cannot account for the change in MS symptoms and hormonally related factors may be important.
        </p>

        <p>        
            Menopause does not appear to have any positive or negative<sup>127</sup> effect on MS. Whether hormonal fluctuations in menstrual cycles or menopause are associated with exacerbations of MS symptoms has been difficult to address<sup>123,125,128,129</sup>. Although about one half of patients reported worsening of MS symptoms at menopause, there are no definitive conclusions possible due to the low number of patients involved and the difficulty to differentiate between the subjective worsening as a consequence of hormonal changes and the natural progression of the disease which often occurs at that age (relapsing-remitting MS converting into a more progressive pathology). Moreover, serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based examinations were unable to show differences in brain lesion activity during ovarian cycle<sup>130</sup>.

        <p>
            There is anecdotal evidence, as well as a few small studies, which indicate that any symptoms which worsen during menopause may be 
            responsive to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and that the majority of women with MS who have used this therapy report improvement 
            rather than deterioration in their condition. Given that loss of bone density may be a problem for women with MS, the beneficial effect 
            of HRT in reducing the risk of osteoporosis – particularly if they are prone to falling – should be taken into account.
