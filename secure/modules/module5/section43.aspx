        <h2>4.3 Psychological Assessments</h2>
    
        <p>
            At present, there are no standardised, formal psychological assessment tools used by all
            countries. However, similar assessments are carried out throughout the world by MS Nurses
            using both paper-based and computerised tools.

            Assessments might include the following:
        </p>
    
        <ul>
            <li><span>Assess which factors influence coping strategies such as support and education</span></li>
            <li><span>Assess how the individual is coping with the diagnosis and identify which adjustment
                stage they are currently in</span></li>
            <li><span>Assess the individual’s level of dependence on others</span></li>
            <li><span>Assess type of coping skills – are they problem-focussed or emotion-focussed?</span></li>
            <li><span>Assess non-pharmacological health-maintenance behaviours such as exercise</span></li>
            <li><span>Assess whether employment, disability, financial or child care issues need to be
                addressed immediately</span></li>
            <li><span>Identify therapy options and make appropriate referrals.</span></li>
            <li><span>Assess social support available such as family or caregiver</span></li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            Psychological tests assess a range of mental abilities and attributes, including achievement and
            ability, personality, and neurological functioning. Psychological testing, including 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1">neuropsychological assessment
            </a>, allows for an assessment of a patient's cognitive and
            behavioural functioning and an analysis of changes related to mental or physical disease, injury,
            or abnormal development of the brain. Research has shown that the scores from these tests are
            reproducible and can be compared to those of normal persons of similar age, sex and
            demographic background to yield valid conclusions.

                A neuropsychological assessment can provide detailed information on a
                patient’s cognitive strengths and weaknesses, and the likely practical impact of this profile upon
                the patients’ capacity to function in various aspects of their everyday life. Some of the more
                ‘executive level’ examples could include reporting on the likely impact of cognitive impairment on a 
                patient’s capacity to make important, complex decisions (eg appointing a power of attorney), to make 
                reasonable judgments about risks and benefits of a potential course of action (eg taking an experimental 
                drug, or giving up their job), or to be insightful about their capacity to perform certain tasks 
                (eg deciding not to move into supported accommodation).
            </p>
            <p>
                This sort of detailed neuropsychological assessment also usually leads to recommendations about the best 
                practical strategies to use for managing any identified impairments.
            </p>

        <p>
            Formal neuropsychological evaluation is not necessary for everyone, but in cases where cognitive 
            impairment may impair a patient’s capacity to function effectively in the workplace or at home, 
            some form of screening to provide insight into the nature and extent of cognitive deficits is advised.
        </p>
        <p>
            MS Nurses are unlikely to carry out this kind of formal assessment but they may notice some early 
            warning signs which they can then follow-up with the relevant healthcare provider within the 
            multidisciplinary team. If there is a need for a formal neuropsychological evaluation it must 
            be done by an expert.
