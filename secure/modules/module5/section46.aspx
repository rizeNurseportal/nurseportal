        <h2>4.6 Stress</h2>

        <p>
          It is widely believed by people with MS, relatives and some professionals, that stress of almost any type may precipitate a relapse and worsen the symptoms of MS. Some patients are even advised to avoid certain stressors, e.g.
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1">emotional stress, trauma </a>
            and certain medical interventions. The evidence for an association is limited and/or conflicting. However, a recent national cohort study in Denmark provides little evidence for a causal association between major stressful life events (as exemplified by divorce or the loss of a child or a spouse) and subsequent MS risk.<sup>45</sup> But there are NO certainties about relationships between the pathological response to stress, its’ role within the auto-immune system and subsequent auto-immune mediated disease.

                Emotional stress – evidence is conflicting regarding an association between stress and 
                MS relapses. Several studies have shown no significant association between stressful 
                life events or psychological stress, and MS relapses. However, increased conflict and 
                disruption in routine daily hassles have been reported to increase relapse rates. 
                There is also a significantly increased risk of MS progression when the rate of 
                reported stressful events is higher<sup>45</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trauma – evidence to support a relationship between trauma and MS relapse is sparse 
                and no association has been found between head injury or lumbar disc surgery and the onset of MS<sup>1</sup>.

            Nevertheless, in a meta-analysis review, the majority of studies were found to 
            suggest that stress was associated with an increased risk of relapse<sup>46</sup>. For 
            example, a 2-year prospective study in RRMS found that patients who reported 
            significant negative stressful life-events were 3.7 times more likely to have a 
            relapse than those unexposed to stress<sup>47</sup>.

            Higher stress levels also appear to increase the risk of development of gadolinium-enhancing lesions. A recent randomized trial shows that reducing stress using stress management therapy (SMT), a cognitive-behavioural therapy approach, results in a statistically significant reduction in new magnetic resonance imaging lesions.<sup>48</sup>
