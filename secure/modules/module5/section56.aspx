        <h2>5.6 Bowel Dysfunction</h2>

        <p>
            Bowel dysfunction is common in people with MS. An online survey of 155 people with MS suggested that 
            few strategies employed by patients resulted in successful bowel management and that there was a 
            need for high-quality research on all aspects of managing bowel dysfunction in MS in order to 
            improve patients' QoL<sup>81</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although general recommendations for management of bowel dysfunction in MS include maintaining a 
            high-fibre diet, high fluid intake, regular bowel routine and the use of enemas or laxatives, the 
            evidence to support the efficacy of these recommendations is limited<sup>82</sup> and reflected by poor patient
             satisfaction<sup>81</sup>. Biofeedback retraining has been shown to be effective treatment in some 
             patients, particularly those with limited disability and a non-progressive disease course<sup>82</sup> (table 7 and 8).

            It may take several weeks for nonpharmacologic interventions to be effective. The person with MS should 
            understand that the goal of the bowel programme is to have predictable regular eliminations with a soft, 
            formed stool, which decreases the problems of constipation or faecal incontinence. Another goal of an 
            adequate bowel training programme is the long-term avoidance of the need for strong laxatives and enemas.
