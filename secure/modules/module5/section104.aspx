        <p>
            The MS Nurse is a competent expert who collaborates with those affected by MS and 
            shares knowledge, strength, and hope. The experienced MS nurse will use extended 
            skills in making a differential diagnosis, screening for concomitant disease, 
            developing preventative care management programmes and referring or discharging patients.

            sense of control, and give hope and positive attitudes among people with MS and 
            their family members or care partners. Key elements of the role are:
