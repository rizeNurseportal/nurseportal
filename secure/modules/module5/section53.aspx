        <h2>5.3 Fatigue</h2>

        <p>
            The management of MS fatigue can help improve quality of life for people with MS at any stage
            of life. Other symptoms, such as depression, being in pain, or sleep disturbance from bladder
            problems or spasms, can all worsen fatigue. Fatigue may also be the result of inactivity, poor
            diet, stress or an infection. Some medications can increase drowsiness and worsen fatigue.
            This applies to all types of treatments - prescription, over the counter, alternative and illicit -
            regardless of whether they are being used to treat MS or not. Of the drugs for MS symptoms,
            treatments for spasms, stiffness and pain can be associated with an increase in fatigue.

           A thorough assessment by the nurse must include assessment of  diet, fitness, sleep, activity, depression and stress, heat, thyroid function, blood counts and MS status (exacerbation or worsening of MS) (Table 2).

            The next step is to implement strategies that will help manage the effects of fatigue (table 3). 
            Fatigue management and energy conservation have been proposed as effective acute and long-term 
            strategies to minimise fatigue in MS<sup>58,59</sup>. Both approaches rely on a person reflecting on their 
            own fatigue and the way that it affects their daily life. It does not take the fatigue away but 
            aims to make living with fatigue easier:

            Several additional nonpharmacological/complimentary approaches have been proposed (table 4), including 
            physiotherapy<sup>61</sup>, aerobic exercise<sup>62</sup>, yoga<sup>63</sup> or cooling<sup>64</sup>. 
            The observed positive effects have been small, although these approaches did benefit from having no 
            adverse side effects. More recently, a controlled trial has demonstrated that progressive resistance 
            training can improve muscle strength and functional capacity in MS, and this is associated with 
            improvement in fatigue, mood and quality of life<sup>65</sup>.

           In addition to teaching these techniques, a fatigue management programme often involves careful listening,  liaison with statutory services and advice regarding access to disability resources. An occupational therapist can offer education regarding both fatigue management principles as well as practical problem solving which aims to address fatigue related distress at the level of activity and participation. Fatigue management education delivered in a face to face format in community settings has been found to significantly reduce impact of fatigue on daily life, improve QOL and increase self-efficacy in randomised trials<sup>59</sup>. Other ways of delivering the course such as by teleconference were also successful<sup>66</sup>.

            A recent meta-analysis found that rehabilitation interventions (exercise and educational) appeared to have stronger and more significant effects on reducing the impact or severity of patient-reported fatigue compared to medication.<sup>67</sup> It is therefore important that healthcare providers should consider a full spectrum of effective fatigue management interventions, from exercise to educational strategies in conjunction with medication, to successfully manage the challenge.

                    To begin with, I usually use a fatigue scale to confirm the presence and severity of the fatigue. 
                    I try to determine if it is physical (occurring after physical activity) or if it is more prominent after 
                    psychological efforts (for example, following tasks that demand concentration).<br />
                    <br />
                    I ask the person to keep a fatigue diary for several weeks, listing all activities undertaken
                    with a fatigue rating (eg. rating scale from 0-10, using a visual analogue scale that is
                    simple and practical). I recommend patients make a clear plan for the day, to avoid
                    trying to do too many things at one time. Eating small meals several times a day rather
                    than one big meal later in the day can help lessen the effects of fatigue. It is also
                    important to remember to drink regularly to avoid dehydration.
