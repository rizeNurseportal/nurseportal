        <h2>9.4 Household / Activities of Daily Living</h2>

        <p>
            Activities of daily living include those needed around the house to maintain life and safety and a
            reasonable standard of cleanliness. They include cooking, washing up, all aspects of managing
            clothing (e.g. washing, ironing) and keeping the house clean. They may also include for some
            people other activities such as caring for children, and responding to financial and other
            demands such as paying bills. In contrast to personal activities, domestic activities often make
            more demands on cognitive skills, and consequently may be affected more by cognitive deficits.

            An individual’s ability to conduct every day activities has a huge influence on their ability to be
            independent. A significant proportion of people with MS may eventually experience limitations
            on their ability to undertake activities such as shopping, housework and undertaking personal
            care. Occupational or rehabilitation therapists are usually the professional group with most
            expertise who lead the rehabilitation of activities of daily living.

        <p>
            When assessing a person with MS for their ability in daily activities it is important to determine
            the person’s previous and current functioning, to understand their goals, and support caregivers
            aspirations and priorities as well as their actual potential. It is also worth considering both their
            current needs and those in the future. Following this assessment, a programme of interventions
            should be developed for the person with MS, with the aim of increasing and maintaining
            independence wherever possible, which is fully agreed by the individual. The interventions
            should be goal-directed, and designed to meet the individual’s priorities, interests and potential<sup>1</sup>.
            There should be regular monitoring to check how effective the interventions are, with a view to
            changing them if necessary<sup>1</sup>.

            The occupational therapist and/or the rehabilitation nurse can help patients improve their
            activities of daily living as well as their mobility. Practical techniques and assistive devices ease
            the burdens of dressing, bathing, eating, household chores, and daily care.
