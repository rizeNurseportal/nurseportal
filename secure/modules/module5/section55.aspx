        <h1>5.5 Bladder Dysfunction</h1>
    
        <p>
            Poor bladder control is very disabling and many regard this as one of the worst aspects 
            of their MS<sup>78</sup>. Unpredictable urinary urgency, frequency and a danger of incontinence 
            will make a person unwilling to venture out, and housebound, when access to toilets is uncertain.

            The MS Nurse is likely to be in a position to initiate the process of identifying urological 
            dysfunction. The evaluation can be started by reviewing symptoms recorded in the patient's medical 
            records over time (table 5). Along with the use of a voiding diary and a check of the patient's 
            post-void residual at the time of each visit, this can aid the MS nurse in recognising which 
            urinary dysfunction could be affecting the patient<sup>79</sup>.

        <div id="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdivepopup">
            Intermittent catheterisation is a technique for managing urinary problems related to insufficient 
            emptying of the bladder. The aims of intermittent catheterisation are to prevent infections, avoid 
            residual urine in the bladder, improve bladder elasticity, promote continence and protect kidneys<sup>79</sup>. 
            Catheterisation allows for complete emptying of the bladder at scheduled intervals, therefore 
            frequency and nocturia can be significantly reduced. The nurse has the challenge of helping the 
            patient accept intermittent catheterisation as a part of the rehabilitation process, as, if performed 
            according to a prescribed schedule, it can promote improved bladder functioning. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Adequate information and through instruction by nurses help empower people to take control and master 
            the treatment, which can potentially contribute to ongoing compliance and long-term urinary tract 
            health. A major requirement for success with this technique is patient motivation. As a general rule, 
            if patients are able to write and feed themselves they are likely to be able to perform the technique<sup>79</sup>.

        <p>
            The UK consensus statement on the management of the bladder in MS<sup>80</sup> stated that successful management 
            could be achieved based on a simple algorithm which includes testing for a urinary tract infection and 
            measurement of the post micturition residual urine volume. Obtaining a detailed urinary history, often 
            combined with the keeping of a micturition diary, can also be valuable in determining the source of 
            MS-related bladder dysfunction. This is in contrast with guidelines from other countries that recommend 
            cystometry. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The MS Nurse can also have an important role in teaching the person with MS behaviour strategies that 
            aid in both evaluating and treating urinary dysfunction. The MS Nurse is often the primary instructor 
            of techniques related to intermittent catheterisation procedures.
