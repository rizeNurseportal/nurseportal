        <h2>4.5 Anxiety</h2>
    
        <p>
            Regardless of specific medical problems, living with MS can be a source of strain. 
            The loss of functions, altered life circumstances and not knowing how one will feel 
            from day to day are significant causes of anxiety. Anxiety can be described as a 
            feeling of unease, worry or fear that can become so persistent that it affects a person's 
            ability to function normally. Anxiety can cause a physical response that produces 
            symptoms such as tiredness, insomnia, weakness, the urge to go to the toilet and a 
            blurring of vision.

            Anxiety has been poorly studied in MS, although it is a common emotional impairment associated 
            with the condition. Lifetime prevalence of anxiety disorders in people with MS is 36%<sup>40</sup>. 
            Anxiety symptoms are associated with fatigue, depression, sleep disturbance, problem-solving 
            deficits, pain, and disability status<sup>41,42</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            People with MS with anxiety disorders are more likely to be female, and to have a lifetime 
            diagnosis of depressive disorder or alcohol abuse. They are also more likely to report greater 
            social stress, less social support and to have contemplated suicide<sup>43</sup>. In one study, 
            only 34% of those with an anxiety disorder had previously been given a documented psychiatric 
            diagnosis; and none were given a specific diagnosis of anxiety disorder. Less than half of 
            participants were receiving any treatment<sup>43</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Social anxiety has also been found to be common. In one study, 31% of clinic patients met 
            criteria for social phobia (fear and avoidance of social situations) on the Social Phobia 
            Inventory. This was not associated with severity of disability. The presence of social phobia 
            was associated with reduced health-related quality of life<sup>44</sup>. To date, no pharmacological 
            treatments for social phobia in MS have been reported in the literature.

            A counsellor, psychologist or MS Nurse can help with these problems through encouraging 
            the individual to develop self help strategies such as relaxation techniques, discussing

            may also help to ease anxiety. In more severe cases medication may be prescribed.
