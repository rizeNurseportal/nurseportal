              The impact of MS on a person’s sexual functioning must not be underestimated. Symptoms such as spasticity, urinary incontinence, and fatigue interfere with sexual health and well-being.. Medications such as anticholinergics, used to manage MS symptoms, together with medications used to treat other common health problems,will affect sexual functioning<sup>131</sup>. Alterations in body image will negatively impact a patient’s perception of himself or herself as a sexual being. 

            </p>
            <p>A recent study found that moderate-to-severe pelvic floor symptoms are extremely common among MS patients, with 41% reporting bladder, 30% reporting bowel, and 42% reporting sexual dysfunction. Most respondents had been asked about bladder (61%) or bowel (50%) issues by their health-care providers, but only 20% had been queried about sexual dysfunction. Most respondents were moderately to very satisfied with the management of their bladder and bowel disorders but significantly less satisfied with that of sexual dysfunction.<sup>132</sup></p>
            <p>In patients with MS, sexual dysfunction has a much larger detrimental impact on the mental health aspects of HrQoL than severity of physical disability.<sup>133</sup> Therefore this reinforces the need for physicians and nurses to ask patients with MS about their sexual concerns.</p>

            The impact of MS on a person’s sexual functioning should not be
            underestimated. Symptoms interfere with this aspect of a person’s life. In addition,
            medications used to manage MS symptoms, as well as medications used to treat other
            common health problems, can affect sexual functioning.

            The nature of sexual problems make discussion difficult for both people with MS and
            healthcare professionals. Individuals may not be aware that MS can affect sexual functioning
            and assessment of these needs is important. MS nurses need to be aware of the complexity of
            sexual dysfunction, ensuring that problems are detected and fully assessed so that appropriate
            treatment can be recommended when necessary, while also ensuring that treatments are not
            given inappropriately<sup>1</sup>.
