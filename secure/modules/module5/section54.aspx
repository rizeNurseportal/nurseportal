        <h2>5.4 Cognition</h2>
    
        <p>
            As the healthcare professional with the most regular contact with people with MS, the MS Nurse plays a pivotal role in recognising potential signs of cognitive problems, identifying the need for  referral for formal evaluation, and regular recall and review of interventions.

            The MS Nurse plays a pivotal role in recognising the signs of
            cognitive problems, identifying the need to refer individuals for formal evaluation, and
            monitoring progress of these deficits and effectiveness of interventions.
        </div>

        <p>
            Although cognitive dysfunction is a sensitive area to broach with people with MS and their
            families, it is now generally accepted that openly recognising the problem is considerably more
            helpful than pretending it does not exist. Recognition allows constructive discussion and the
            learning of compensatory strategies<sup>68</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cognitive impairment is caused by MS lesions; however, secondary factors, such as
            depression, fatigue, medication effects, or comorbid conditions including thyroid,
            cerebrovascular, cardiopulmonary disease or sleep disorders may also contribute<sup>60</sup>. People with
            MS may complain of having trouble concentrating, remembering daily job or home routines, and
            making decisions<sup>60</sup>. However, an individual may not recognise subtle cognitive symptoms and
            should be asked whether they are having difficulty remembering appointments or conversations,
            understanding written material, or being easily distracted and having difficulty focusing on
            tasks<sup>69</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Several different questionnaires and testing batteries have been proposed for screening and
            evaluation of cognitive deficits in people with MS<sup>70,71</sup>, but there is no general consensus on
            which questionnaires and tests are most beneficial. BICAMS (Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS) is an international initiative to recommend and support a cognitive assessment that is brief, practical and universal. It includes tests of mental processing speed and memory. Preliminary validation studies are currently underway in a number of countries.
        </p>

        <p>
           Cognitive impairment may be improved by addressing secondary causes and comorbid conditions, and by limiting distractions and organising tasks at home or work<sup>60</sup>.  Recent evidence suggests that a "mentally active lifestyle" could potentially prevent or slow further cognitive decline<sup>72</sup>.  It may be beneficial for patients and family members to be aware of, and understand, cognitive issues, to develop coping strategies, and begin to take advantage of individual strengths that  compensate for impairments, and adjust expectations<sup>73</sup>.

                What might you look for, and what questions might you ask, when
                assessing for signs/ indicators of difficulties with cognition?
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="nursetippopup1" class="nursetippopup">
            There are a number of things I look out for in my patients including:
            <ul>
                <li><span>Are they following my instructions regarding their medication?</span></li>
                <li><span>Are they missing any of our scheduled appointments?</span></li>
                <li><span>Are they having any difficulty taking part in our discussions?</span></li>
                <li><span>Has the carer/patient reported any changes in behaviour (memory, concentration, ability
                    to follow instructions)?</span></li>
            </ul>
            When discussing cognitive problems with my patients, I explain some of the things that MS
            patients report (for example, memory problems and problems with concentration). I then ask the
            person if they have experienced any of these things. In normal circumstances, the discussion
            will lead on from here and I am able to ask, for example, about any possible problems at work /
            household issues etc.
            <br />
            <br />
            I also explain that fatigue can sometimes cause cognitive problems, but that these problems
            disappear after rest; heat can also have a similar effect - for example, in Finland people love
            saunas and afterwards there can be fatigue and some cognitive problems which will resolve
            with time.

            MS Nurses may help people with MS and their families adjust to cognitive deficits. Figure 4 lists
            strategies that have proved helpful in the management of cognitive problems. Nurses could
            suggest these strategies to patients and their families and work with them to overcome some of
            the problems presented by cognitive impairment.

            Management of cognitive impairment is difficult and cognitive rehabilitation in MS is in 
            its relative infancy<sup>74</sup>, although nonpharmacological therapeutic procedures, particularly 
            types of cognitive training, have been shown to be at least partially effective<sup>75-77</sup>.
