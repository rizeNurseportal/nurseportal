        <h2>8.3 Assessment</h2>
        <p>
           Assessment and treatment of sexual problems should combine medical and psychosexual approaches and begin early. Intervention may be by recognising sexual needs, educating and providing information, by letting patients express their difficulties and referral  to specialists and other information resources. People should be offered information about locally available counselling and supportive services. If all else fails psychosexual counselling may be considered<sup>134</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
           Sexual expression is relevant to everyone. Sexual functioning with a new partner, or about finding a partner in the face of mobility problems, continence difficulties and so on, need the opportunity to be voiced.
        </p>

        <div class="keypoint">
            Sexual expression is no less of an issue for those not in a relationship. Often there is a greater degree of reticence about asking for help.

            A commonly used model in facilitating discussion of sexual dysfunction is known as the 
            <a href="#" rel="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdive">P-LI-SSIT model</a>. This is a hierarchical model that 
            can be applied by any healthcare professional to the point at which they feel able to 
            operate<sup>135</sup>.The components of the acronym are pyramidal; many people will benefit from 
            the first intervention but few from the fourth. All healthcare professionals can undertake 
            the first step in the PLISSIT model providing they are prepared to listen. This alone can 
            be of immense therapeutic benefit.

                <b>P –</b> giving people permission to discuss sex and relationship worries. Professionals should be
                able to pick up cues or ask specifically about sex and relationship issues. “MS can have quite
                an effect on the more intimate side of life. Has that caused you any concern?” <br />
                <br />
                <b>LI –</b> providing limited information about any areas of concern. This can be done by whoever the
                person with MS has confided in. If they feel unable to provide information, then having listened
                to the problem they can make a referral to another agency such as a sexual dysfunction clinic,
                counselling or Relate. Acknowledgement of the problem and empowerment to look further for
                help is very important. <br />
                <br />
                <b>SS –</b> providing specific suggestions, for example about how to manage continence problems to
                allow sexual intimacy, managing fatigue, positioning to avoid spasm or pain. Many of these
                suggestions are made most appropriately by a professional with knowledge of neurological
                problems rather than just skill in treating sexual dysfunction. <br />
                <br />
                <b>IT –</b> intensive therapy. Specialised psychosexual therapy. The majority of problems can be dealt
                with earlier in this model.
