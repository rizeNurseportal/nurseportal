        <h2>8.4 Role of the MS Nurse</h2>

        <p>
            The MS Nurse is typically not an expert in this area; some nurses may wish to gain additional
            expertise in this area but for most it is something that will be managed by the primary care
            provider or another expert from the multidisciplinary team. The nurse will almost certainly
            identify that there is an issue and then reassure the patient he/she will make an appropriate
            referral if desired.
        </p>

        <p>
            The MS Nurse should try and develop an organised method for evaluating sexual functioning
            and people’s concerns. Numerous conceptual frameworks are available to assist the nurse in 
            collecting health information pertinent to sexual assessment. Questions should be direct 
            and open-ended, assess sexual functioning and satisfaction, and incorporate sensitivity to 
            cultural belief systems. Most importantly, careful discernment is crucial when determining 
            the timing and context in which to assess sexual functioning, and the patient’s partner should 
            be present whenever possible. Recommended questions for MS Nurses to ask when assessing sexual 
            function in people with MS are provided <br />in table 13.

            Anticipating patient concerns and potential obstacles enable the nurse to intervene with helpful 
            suggestions that increase patient understanding and long-term success in treatment outcomes as 
            prescribed by the physician (table 14). In collaboration with the physician—and together with 
            appropriate community resources—the nurse should continually engage in the patient’s long-term 
            care plan. MS Nurses may see patients at office visits, but they also help on the phone when 
            patients forget instructions, need positive reinforcement, and/or have questions related to 
            sexual dysfunction. As resources are provided by the healthcare team, nurses should reinforce 
            the importance of these resources and intervene with nursing guidance if necessary.
