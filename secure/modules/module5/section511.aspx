        <h3>5.11.1 Introduction</h3>

        <p>
            Pressure sores, also referred to as pressure ulcers, bed sores, or decubitus ulcers, are areas of 
            localised damage to the skin, which usually occur over bony prominences in any area of the body<sup>94</sup>. 
            Pressure sores may range from minor breaks to very large deep areas of dead tissues extending over 
            many square centimetres; the skin can erode all the way down to the muscle, or even the bone. Once 
            present they can be difficult to heal, and can cause general malaise and worsening of most impairments, 
            and they carry a risk of generalised or localised infections.

        <h3>5.11.2 Pathophysiology of Pressure Sores </h3>

        <p>
            When pressure of short duration is relieved, tissues demonstrate reactive hyperaemia, reflecting 
            increased blood flow to the area. However, sustained high pressure leads to decreased capillary 
            blood flow, occlusion of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, and tissue ischaemia (see figure 6). 
            These changes are ultimately responsible for necrosis of muscle, subcutaneous tissue, dermis and 
            epidermis, and consequent formation of pressure ulcers<sup>95</sup>.

        <h3>5.11.3 What causes pressure sores?</h3>

        <p>
            Pressure sores are caused by a combination of factors both outside and inside the body. The three external 
            factors which can cause pressure ulcers either on their own or in any combination are 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1">pressure, shear and friction</a>.
        </p>

        <div id="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdivepopup">
            <p>
                Pressure is the most important factor in pressure ulcer development. Shearing occurs when the body 
                weight is sliding against a surface, for example when poorly seated or sliding down a bed away from 
                a back rest. Friction is caused when two surfaces rub together, often skin against a bed or a chair 
                surface. Any moisture present on the skin as a result of excessive sweating or incontinence will 
                exacerbate the problem - the effects of friction are up to five times worse if moisture is present.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            While immobility is a primary cause, other factors also increase the risk of pressure sores. These 
            include paralysis or spasticity, which can decrease mobility; numbness and loss of sensation, which 
            can result in the inability to feel the friction or irritation; advanced age, which is often 
            accompanied by decreased mobility; poor nutrition, which hinders healing of the skin; and incontinence, 
            because moist, wet or soiled skin can exacerbate the irritation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additional factors that are known to place people at even higher risk of acquiring pressure ulcers include:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span>neurologically compromised</span></li>
            <li><span>obese or underweight</span></li>
            <li><span>poor posture</span></li>
            <li><span>using equipment, such as seating or beds, which does not provide appropriate pressure 
                        relief<sup>97</sup></span></li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <h3>5.11.4 Role of the MS Nurse in Managing Pressure Sores</h3>

        <p>
           Most pressure ulcers can be avoided by good anticipatory management. A systematic evaluation of risk factors will help to identify patients at risk of pressure ulceration. Those at risk must be assessed regularly, and risk assessment scales must be used as an adjunct to, not a substitute for, clinical judgment<sup>98</sup>. Several risk assessment scales are currently used, including the Norton Scale, Waterlow scoring system and the Braden score, but vary in the risk factors assessed.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Patients and carers should be advised of warning signs that can increase the risk of developing a 
            pressure ulcer. Questions the nurse should consider include:
        </p>
    
        <ul>
            <li><span>Are you eating or drinking less than usual?</span></li>
            <li><span>Is moving becoming more difficult?</span></li>
            <li><span>Is your skin regularly exposed to moisture?</span></li>
            <li><span>Is your skin prone to being very dry, sore or red?</span></li>
            <li><span>Have you been ill recently?</span></li>
            <li><span>Have you lost or gained a lot of weight recently?</span></li>
            <li><span>Has there been any change in your level of spasms?</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Spasms can cause friction and shearing forces on the skin and a vicious cycle can be entered 
            whereby the spasms cause the wound to worsen and the wound exacerbates the spasms. Every person 
            with MS who uses a wheelchair should be assessed for their risk of developing a pressure ulcer<sup>90</sup>. 
            The individual should be informed of the risk, and offered appropriate advice. Whenever they are 
            admitted to hospital (for whatever reason), their need for pressure-relieving devices and procedures 
            should be assessed. The assessment should be clinical, specifically taking into account the risk features 
            associated with MS, and not simply the recording of a pressure ulcer risk score; it should lead to the 
            development and documentation of an action plan to minimise risk (table 12).
