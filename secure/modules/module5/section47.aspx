        <h2>4.7 Coping Strategies</h2>
        
        <p>
            Coping strategies are psychological defence mechanisms that assist in adaptation to a variety of stressful life problems, including chronic disease. Many coping strategies exist, including mechanisms such as escape-avoidance, problem solving, seeking social support, positive reappraisal, and more. How an individual with MS copes depends on factors such as personality, past experiences, social support, their economic situation as well as their MS course.

        <p>
            For many people with MS, the unpredictability of exacerbations, extent of recovery, 
            and impact of residual symptoms on daily life can challenge coping mechanisms. 
            McCabe and colleagues noted that people who engaged in more emotion-focused coping 
            styles (wishful thinking) were more likely to experience poor psychological adjustment 
            than those who employed more problem-focused strategies. They demonstrated that women 
            in general, both with and without MS, were more likely to focus on the positive and 
            seek social support than were men, and that levels of fatigue and medication impact 
            were factors in psychological adjustment and coping<sup>49</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Aside from MS-related variables such as fatigue, cognition, depression, and medication 
            effects, there are factors related to family of origin which may affect coping strategies. 
            Some of these include cultural, ethnic, spiritual, and socioeconomic backgrounds, 
            as well as family support. All of these factors need to be considered when generating 
            an effective care plan for optimising quality of life in MS.
        </p>

        <p>
            Joining a support group, where the person with MS can share experiences and feelings 
            with other people who are likely to have had similar experiences, may be helpful. 
            In Finland, the benefit of meeting people who have the similar situation in their 
            lives has been reported to be the most important issue regarding coping and adaptation 
            to a new life situation. Furthermore, in groups it is possible to express difficult 
            feelings that a person may not want to share with their family. Support groups often 
            provide information and advice about coping strategies as well as practical issues 
            such as technical aids, civil rights and so on.The creation of new adjustment groups whereby nurses can introduce cognitive behavioural principles for people with MS could be an effective way for individuals to learn new skills, new means of managing their emotions, and new behavioural techniques to improve existing mood disorders and aid adjustment to the condition that they can use throughout their lives.<sup>50</sup> Hope is also an important protective coping resource for coping with MS and should not be neglected.<sup>51</sup>
