                The clinical presentation of MS presents a number of diagnostic challenges. There is 
                no single sign or symptom that is specific to MS and, to further complicate matters, 
                there is a broad range of presenting symptoms. In the early stages of the condition, 
                MS signs and symptoms are frequently short-lived and therefore, may not be readily 
                detectable. This module will review the different types of MS and their clinical features, 
                including atypical presentation of the condition. Common symptoms will be discussed and 
                defined, along with the prognosis of people with MS.
