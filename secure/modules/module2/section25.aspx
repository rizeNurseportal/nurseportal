            According to internationally accepted terminology, the clinical courses of MS are 
            categorised as relapsing remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary 
            progressive (PPMS) and progressive relapsing (PRMS)<sup>11</sup>. A relapse is defined 
            as an acute episode of neurological symptoms that worsen for some days and then improve 
            or completely subside over time. A period of 30 days should separate the onset of two e
            vents for them to be considered as separate attacks<sup>12</sup>.

        <h3>2.5.1 Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS)</h3>

        <p>
            The most common presenting course of MS is relapsing-remitting (RRMS). In about 85% of 
            all people with MS, the condition follows a relapsing-remitting pattern at onset, with 
            relapses occurring randomly over many years and with minimal accumulation of disability 
            or change in disease progression<sup>13</sup>. 
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            RRMS is characterised by acute attacks of neurologic dysfunction that generally evolve 
            over days to weeks, followed by either complete or partial recovery<sup>11</sup> (see Figure 1). 
            Those with partial recovery have what is called ‘stepwise worsening’. The important 
            point to remember regarding RRMS is the lack of evident change in disease course between 
            relapses. That is, whatever level function is at the end of a relapse, it remains at 
            that level until the next attack<sup>14</sup>.

        <p>
            RRMS varies greatly in severity from individual to individual. The annual relapse rate in 
            untreated patients initially averages about 2–2.5<sup>15</sup>, and thereafter it will 
            gradually fall as the years progress. It is considered a poor prognostic sign if the person 
            experiences frequent relapses, especially at the onset of the disease<sup>16</sup>.

        <h3>2.5.2 Secondary-progressive MS (SPMS)</h3>

        <p>
            Secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) is defined as progression of clinical disability (with 
            or without relapses and minor fluctuations) after a relapsing-remitting onset<sup>17</sup>. 
            The person with MS does not completely recover from relapses/attacks and disability 
            progresses even between the relapses<sup>18</sup> (see Figure 2). A patient can have superimposed 
            relapses, but the main distinction is a gradual worsening of function between attacks. 
        </p>

        <p>
            A significant percentage of individuals with RRMS will go on to SPMS. For an individual with 
            RRMS, the risk of developing SPMS is ~2.5% each year, which means that the majority of RRMS 
            ultimately evolves into SPMS within a median time interval of 19 years<sup>19</sup>. In 50–70% 
            of people diagnosed with RRMS, the disease course becomes steadily more progressive over time. 
            This pattern may or may not involve occasional relapses, plateaus, and remissions. 
        </p>

        <p>
            When assessing people with MS, it can be difficult to establish when they are converting from 
            RRMS to SPMS. The Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) can provide the Neurologist 
            with an indicator of whether the patient is entering the secondary-progressive phase of the 
            disease. Patients at EDSS 4.0–5.5 are those most at risk of developing SPMS<sup>20</sup>.

        <h3>2.5.3 Primary-progressive MS (PPMS)</h3>

        <p>
            Primary-progressive MS (PPMS) is characterised by a disease course that worsens continuously 
            from onset, with only occasional plateaus or temporary improvements (see Figure 3). In this 
            form of MS, the symptoms develop faster and the disease is progressive from the outset without 
            any discernible relapses or remissions<sup>13,21</sup>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            PPMS is found in approximately 10–15% of the MS population and, as opposed to other forms of MS, 
            there is no increased likelihood for women to have this form of the disease<sup>22</sup>. The 
            unique clinical characteristics of this form make its diagnosis difficult and prolonged<sup>23</sup>.

        </div>

        <p>
            PPMS usually begins later in life (than RRMS) (mean age ~40 years), but in rare cases it can occur 
            at an earlier age. It typically presents with an increasing spastic gait that is already affecting 
            walking ability. The prognosis is poorer than for other forms; the time taking to reach EDSS 6.0 
            is approximately six years<sup>24</sup>. Definitive diagnostic criteria for PPMS include clinical progression 
            for at least a year<sup>24</sup>. In PPMS the MRI of the brain can look normal as the plaques 
            characteristically form in the spinal cord. Consequently, to diagnose PPMS it is essential for a 
            patient also to have a spinal MRI.

        <h3>2.5.4 Progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS)</h3>

        <p>
            PRMS is the least common form of MS, affecting only about 5% of people, and involves continuous 
            disease progression from the outset with superimposed relapses<sup>25</sup> (Figure 4). There is significant 
            recovery immediately following a relapse, but between relapses there is a gradual worsening of 
            symptoms1. Identifying this type of MS has important implications for treatment.
