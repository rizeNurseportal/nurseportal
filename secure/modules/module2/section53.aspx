        <h2>5.3 Paediatric Presentation / Early-Onset MS</h2>

        <p>        
            Paediatric MS has long been an under-recognised and undertreated MS subgroup. However, over the past 
            ten years awareness has grown of the special diagnostic challenges, the clinical course and the special 
            needs of these patients. While some aspects of the clinical disease in children resemble those of 
            adults, MS in children can also differ dramatically from that in adults in clinical, radiological and 
            laboratory features<sup>120</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The proportion of patients with MS aged below 16 years is estimated to be 2.7–5%<sup>121</sup>. The 
            frequency is much lower (0.2–0.7%) among young children (aged 10 years and younger)<sup>122,123</sup>. 
            As in adults with MS, <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1"> paediatric MS</a>
            displays an overall female preponderance. However, the gender ratio varies with age of onset: in 
            children with onset of MS before 6 years of age, the female-to-male ratio is almost equal at 0.8:1. 
            But the female-to-male ratio increases to 1.6:1 for an onset between 6 and 10 years of age, and 
            even further to 2:1 for onset at over ten years of age<sup>124</sup>.
        </p>
        <div id="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdivepopup">        
            There are some additional aspects of the demographic profile of paediatric MS that differ from those in 
            adults with MS. In an outpatient centre in Boston, a higher proportion of African-Americans was found 
            in the paediatric onset category compared to the adult onset MS group (7.4 vs. 4.3%)<sup>123</sup>. Others 
            have noted greater ethnic diversity and ancestry in paediatric MS compared to adult MS<sup>125</sup>. A 
            positive family history of MS is seen in 6–20% of children with the disease<sup>126</sup>.
        </div>

        <p>
            When compared to adults with MS, children with MS have a higher rate of relapse within the first two years 
            of the condition but progress more gradually<sup>127</sup>. Although the clinical course may be favourable 
            initially, patients with EOMS can be more disabled at an earlier age<sup>128</sup>. The risk of secondary 
            progressive MS in children (as in adults) is associated with a higher frequency of relapses and shorter intervals 
            between attacks in the first few years of the disease.

            Children often exhibit systemic symptoms, such as malaise, irritability and/or low-grade fever, which are 
            similar to symptoms of encephalomyelitis or metabolic encephalopathy. Children may be under-diagnosed due 
            to the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is more common than EOMS.</span></li>
            <li><span>A multitude of CNS diseases mimic MS.</span></li>
            <li><span>Diagnosis is often delayed until adulthood.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>        
            Being told of the diagnosis of MS is traumatic for the child/young person and their family. The fact that the 
            prognosis is uncertain and the condition is rare contributes to the difficulty the family faces in adjustment. 
            A number of considerations should go into the process of conveying the diagnosis. It is important to 
            emphasise to the family that they are not alone and that online social network groups, support groups and 
            literature specific to the topic of paediatric MS are available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Challenges exist for both children and parents related to dealing with the unpredictable nature of MS, 
            behavioural changes and the potential for major disability<sup>129</sup>. Shock and dismay are common 
            feelings that parents and caregivers experience when having to face the diagnosis of MS in a child or 
            adolescent<sup>130</sup>. The most common age group to be affected by paediatric MS is adolescence. 
            Sensitivity is essential when dealing with teenagers as they may be particularly vulnerable psychologically. 
            The paucity of research available on the topic and its management can make assisting with psychosocial issues 
            more difficult<sup>129</sup>. As with other chronic medical diseases, a sense of isolation, dependence on 
            long-term treatment and the need for self-management may result in this group being at a greater risk of 
            behavioural problems.

                Do you think there are different needs when supporting an adolescent recently diagnosed with MS and their family?

                Adolescents recently diagnosed with MS can pose a particular challenge. Reviewing their typical needs in 
                growth and development is of primary importance. They are often feeling the need to be very independent 
                and may not respond well to the restrictions MS may impose as relapses occur. Being told of the diagnosis 
                of MS is traumatic for the young person and their family. The fact that the prognosis is uncertain and 
                the condition is rare contributes to the difficulty the family faces in adjustment. As with other chronic 
                medical diseases, a sense of isolation, dependence on long-term treatment and the need for self-management 
                may result in this group being at a greater risk of behavioural problems. Sensitivity is essential when 
                dealing with teenagers as they may be particularly vulnerable psychologically.
