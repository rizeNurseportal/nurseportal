			4.4 Summary</h2>
		<div class="icon_summary">
			<ul class="noindent">
                <li><span>MS is associated with a number of symptoms, including vision difficulties, speaking and 
                            swallowing difficulties, weakness, pain, tremors, bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction, 
                            thinking and memory problems, depression, fatigue and episodic symptoms. </span></li>
                <li><span>Relapses are common and caused by inflammatory activity within the central nervous system. </span></li>
                <li><span>They are classed as fairly acute episodes, defined by an increase in symptoms lasting 
                            at least 24–48 hours occurring after a period of stability of at least 30 days. </span></li>               
                <li><span>The extent of recovery from relapse and the duration of any given relapse are difficult 
                            to predict and this understandably causes a great deal of anxiety. </span></li>
                <li><span>The role of the MS Nurse in assessing the nature of the problem and providing 
                            information and support to patients and their families is key. </span></li>
                <li><span>The MS Nurse is also important in ruling out any other possible causes of an exacerbation 
                            of symptoms, such as an infection which may require treating in its own right.</span></li>
