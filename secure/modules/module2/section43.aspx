        <h2>4.3 The Role of the Nurse</h2>
        <p>            
            It is important in the first instance for the MS Nurse to ascertain which symptoms have changed and 
            the time period over which the symptoms have deteriorated – typically a relapse will manifest over a 
            few days or a couple of weeks. Symptoms that have deteriorated over a few months or longer are not 
            indicative of a relapse and are more likely to be associated with signs of progression rather than 
            relapse<sup>26</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is important to remember that a worsening of symptoms and changes in function may not necessarily 
            be a relapse. Other factors can contribute to such changes (e.g., humidity, increased body temperature, 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1">infection</a>, acute or chronic stress or distress). 
        </p>

        <div id="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdivepopup">
            It is not unusual for people to present to the MS Nurse thinking they are experiencing a relapse, only 
            for it to become evident on closer questioning that they have an infection. Any infection can cause a 
            worsening of MS symptoms, although urinary tract infections are often the cause. Infections can be 
            largely asymptomatic while still causing a flare up of MS symptoms, or the symptoms caused by the 
            infection may be confused with those of an MS relapse.
        </div>

        <p>
            The worsening of symptoms may "look like" a relapse when in reality it is not. These episodes may be 
            referred to as pseudoexacerbations or pseudorelapses. Once the underlying cause is addressed, 
            pseudorelapses usually remit.

        <ul>
            <br />
            <li><span>
                <b><i>History of onset of symptoms</i></b> <br />
                Ask the person if the symptoms came on sub-acutely/acutely.  <br />
                When did they start?  <br />
                Have they been there for at least 24 hours?  <br />
                Ask them how their overall condition is different from how they were 30 days previous.  <br />
                What are the symptoms they are experiencing?  <br />
                Are these symptoms new or have they had them before? <br />
                Does anything make them worse?
            </span></li>
            <br />
            <li><span>            
                <b><i>How disabling are the symptoms?</i></b> <br />
                It is important to establish how these ‘new’ symptoms affect the person on a day-to-day basis; 
                what they can’t do now, that they could do a few days ago.  <br />
                How do these symptoms impair them at home or at work?
            </span></li>
            <br />
            <li><span>
                <b><i>Eliminate a pseudorelapse</i></b> <br />
                Prior to confirming a relapse, it is essential to rule out a pseudorelapse, although 
                this is not always straightforward. <br />
                It is essential to ensure patient does not have an infection prior to administration of steroids. <br />
                In some centres, a routine MSU will be taken even if the patient is asymptomatic.<br />
                If there is a recent infection, wait for this to clear before giving steroids. <br />
            </span></li>
            <br />
            <li><span>            
                <b><i>Are the increased symptoms associated with the woman’s menstrual cycle?</i></b> <br />
                It is known that the menstrual cycle can affect MS symptoms. <br />
                Some women with MS report they experience increased fatigue and other symptoms approximately 
                7 days before and 3 days into their period. <br />
                Some women with MS experience an increase in their symptoms associated with menopause.<br />            
            </span></li>
            <br />
            <li><span>
            <b><i>Has the patient commenced any new medication?</i></b> <br />
                Some drugs that are prescribed for people with MS have side effects that may mimic a relapse. <br />
                Ask the patient if they have commenced on any new medication recently.  <br />
            </span></li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
            Lifestyle issues may be important in reducing the risk of relapses. A well-balanced diet and regular 
            exercise will promote good health and can help reduce the risk of relapse triggers. Evidence suggests 
            that relapses can be triggered by infections during the three-month period after giving birth and 
            stressful life events<sup>118</sup>. Surgery, general and epidural anaesthesia, and physical trauma are not 
            associated with an increased risk of relapses.

        <p>
            Experiencing a relapse is always a stressful time for people with MS and their families, and can initiate 
            a fresh cycle of grieving and loss<sup>88,119</sup>. For many of those experiencing a relapse, this will 
            mean they could be temporarily unable to work, or struggle to take care of their children. They may not 
            be able to socialise or attend planned events. 
        </p>
        <p>
            People with MS will typically have a lot of unanswerable questions about when their symptoms will resolve, 
            whether they will make a full recovery or if the relapse is the start of a more progressive phase. The 
            social impact of a relapse cannot be ignored and MS Nurses play a particularly valuable role in supporting 
            patients at this time<sup>26</sup>.
