                MS can be classified according to the stage of the disease course (e.g., early MS) and the 
                age of onset (see Table 3). MS is uncommon in children and adolescents, and those who do 
                suffer from it experience a slower disease course than adults.

                        Early MS is characterised by the occurrence of one clinical flare plus paraclinical criteria that 
                        together allow the diagnosis of MS to be made.  It is important to note that at this stage of 
                        disease a second flare up has not yet occurred.

                        Late-onset MS is defined as the first presentation of clinical symptoms in patients over 50 and its 
                        prevalence ranges between 4% and 9.6%.  The disease course is often primary progressive and LOMS is 
                        associated with a higher and faster rate of progression to irreversible disability than is onset of 
                        MS in younger adults.

                        MS is uncommon in children and adolescents – around 2-5% of people with MS experience their first 
                        symptoms before the age of 16 years.  More than 90% of the paediatric MS population have RRMS. 
                        Disease course is usually slower than in adults but significant disability may still occur by early 
                        adulthood.
