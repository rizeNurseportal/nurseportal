        <h3>3.3.1 Fatigue</h3>

        <p>
            Fatigue is more than tiredness and has been referred to as "pathological exhaustion"<sup>28</sup>. 
            The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines "pathological fatigue" as fatigue 
            that "is not improved by bed rest and that may be worsened by physical or mental activity".
        </p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            Fatigue is the most common symptom of MS, occurring in approximately 75–95% of patients in all 
            age groups and with all types of MS<sup>29-31</sup>. Between 50% and 60% of patients with MS 
            report fatigue as their worst problem, regardless of severity of disease or disability, and 
            up to 69% of patients consider it one of the most <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1"> 
            disabling features</a> of MS<sup>32,33</sup>. Fatigue has been cited as one of the two major reasons 
            for unemployment in MS individuals<sup>34</sup>.
        </p>

        <div id="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdivepopup">
            In a survey of 2,265 people with MS, 94% experienced fatigue, with 87% reporting an impact they 
            rated between moderate and high on their activities of daily living.

        <div class="keypoint">
            Fatigue is the most common symptom of MS, occurring in approximately 75–95% of patients 
            in all age groups and with all types of MS.
        </div>

        <p>
            Fatigue is a primary determinant of poor QOL in MS<sup>35</sup>, affecting both physical and 
            mental components independent of disability level<sup>32</sup>. Fatigue also has a negative effect on 
            cognitive function<sup>36</sup>. It is often described as an invisible symptom as there is no external 
            evidence or internal damage. This can lead to a lack of understanding and frustration from 
            others, as they may believe that the person is just lazy, often causing social isolation<sup>31</sup> 
            and broken relationships.  These views can sometimes be shared by the person with MS as they struggle 
            to deny to themselves how fatigue affects them. It can therefore have a high impact on 
            psychological wellbeing of the person with MS. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Fatigue results from a combination of factors, caused partly by MS itself (known as primary fatigue) 
            and partly by other factors (secondary fatigue) that affect the person with MS more significantly than 
            those without the condition. MS-related fatigue can come on suddenly, even in the morning after a full 
            night's sleep. MS-related fatigue is generally more severe and more likely to interfere with daily 
            responsibilities than normal fatigue. Patient complaints may include tiredness, poor endurance, weakness, 
            difficulty concentrating or mental dullness<sup>37</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Various other factors can contribute to fatigue in MS, including disturbed or reduced sleep, medication 
            effects, increased muscular effort to accomplish daily tasks, depression, comorbid conditions, infections 
            and relapses<sup>36</sup>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Fatigue must be distinguished from limb weakness and from depression, though there may be an 
            inter-dependent relationship between depression and fatigue. Fatigue can have a frightening 
            effect, particularly in relation to cognitive difficulties that can be more noticeable when 
            fatigue is being experienced. Similarly, it can be a worrying problem for carers who may fear 
            that psychological problems are developing, or that inactivity is due to laziness<sup>38,39</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup2"> Heat-sensitive </a> fatigue is well recognised in 
            MS and it has long been considered a unique dimension of MS fatigue differentiating it from fatigue 
            in other conditions. Changes in temperature can cause some patients with MS to become fatigued. This 
            can be triggered by the weather, hot baths or showers, hot drinks or meals, or feeling feverish as a 
            result of infections. These effects are usually quickly reversed when steps are taken to cool down or 
            when the temperature falls<sup>40</sup>.
        </p>

        <div id="deepdivepopup2" class="deepdivepopup">
            <p>
                Many people with MS experience a temporary worsening of their symptoms when the weather is very 
                hot or humid, when they run a fever, sunbathe, get overheated from activity, or take hot showers 
                or baths. A definitive symptom of MS 'heat fatigue' is when vision becomes blurred when the person 
                with MS is overheated; this is a phenomenon known as Uhthoff's sign. These temporary changes can 
                result from even a very slight elevation in core body temperature, as little as 0.5°C. An elevated 
                temperature further impairs the ability of a demyelinated nerve to conduct electrical impulses. 
                For many years' the "Hot Bath" test was used to diagnose MS. A person suspected of having MS was 
                immersed in a tub of hot water, and the appearance of neurologic symptoms or their worsening was 
                taken as evidence that the person had MS.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to remember that heat generally produces only temporary worsening of symptoms and 
                does not cause actual tissue damage (demyelination or damage to the axons themselves), however the 
                use of the "Hot Bath" test has been erroneously associated with permanent tissue damage. Heat-related 
                symptoms are generally rapidly reversed when the source of increased temperature is removed<sup>41</sup>. 
                As with so many other MS symptoms, fatigue can be exacerbated by, or conversely cause exaggeration to 
                cognitive/emotional symptoms, spasticity, exercise tolerance and weakness poor nutrition, speech 
                and swallowing problems.

        <h3>3.3.2 Sleep Disorders</h3>

        <p>
            Sleep disturbances are common in people with MS, with approximately 50% of individuals reporting 
            sleep problems<sup>42</sup>. Treatment of sleep disorders in people with MS is important because 
            poor sleep quality and quantity can affect daily life, causing daytime sleepiness, decreased 
            concentration and memory, worsening depression and the inability to work effectively<sup>43</sup>. 
            Sleep dysfunction can potentially exacerbate other MS symptoms (e.g., mental health problems, 
            fatigue)<sup>44</sup>, and has recently been shown to be an independent predictor of QOL in people with 
            MS<sup>45,46</sup>.
        </p>

        <div class="keypoint">
            Sleep disturbances are common in people with MS, with approximately 50% of individuals 
            reporting sleep problems.
        </div>

        <p>
            The most common sleep disorders seen in patients with MS include insomnia, nocturnal movement 
            disorders, sleep-disordered breathing, narcolepsy, restless leg syndrome and rapid eye movement 
            sleep behaviour disorder<sup>47</sup>. Sleep questionnaires were sent to a group of 473 people 
            with MS<sup>48</sup>. Over 46% had moderate-to-severe sleep problems, but most did not use 
            over-the-counter or prescription sleep aids. Factors found to contribute to sleep problems 
            included anxiety, night-time leg cramps, fatigue and nocturia. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Getting a good night's sleep helps to alleviate many common symptoms of MS, including chronic 
            fatigue, mood and memory problems. Sleep quality can be improved by establishing regular habits 
            or good 'sleep hygiene'. Some sleep hygiene recommendations that might be communicated to the 
            person with MS include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span>Stay as physically active as possible during the day, but allow plenty of time to 
                        wind down before bedtime.</span></li>
            <li><span>Avoid getting overtired by doing too much, as being too tired can make it 
                        difficult to get to sleep.</span></li>
            <li><span>Ensure some daily exposure to sunlight and avoid bright lights in the evening.</span></li>
            <li><span>Avoid unnecessary stress or stimulants (e.g., caffeine, chocolate, alcohol) 
                        in the late afternoon and evening.</span></li>
            <li><span>Establish a bedtime routine that can include, for example, relaxation, a warm 
                        'milky' drink, taking a warm bath.</span></li>
            <li><span>Keep the same nightly ritual every evening throughout the week.</span></li>
            <li><span>Only use the bed as a place for sleeping, not for other activities such as 
                        watching TV.</span></li>
            <li><span>Instead of lying in bed awake, after 15 minutes of not sleeping get out of bed and do 
                        something calming or boring, and return to bed after a short period of time.</span></li>
            <li><span>Avoid getting too hot; keep the bedroom at a comfortable temperature.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The MS Nurse should ask patients about sleep quality and refer patients for further help with 
            sleep-related issues when indicated. By addressing the causes of poor sleep quality and establishing 
            good daily sleep habits and sleep hygiene, people with MS can greatly improve overall energy 
            levels and QOL.
        </p>

        <h3>3.3.3 Vision Impairment</h3>

        <p>
            Visual disturbance is one of the most commonly reported symptoms in MS, with figures up 
            to 80%<sup>49</sup>, and it is the presenting symptom in 25–50% of cases<sup>50</sup>. 
            Abnormalities of vision are usually due to plaque formation along the optic nerve. There 
            can be loss of visual acuity, double vision or tunnel vision (monocular or binocular, 
            depending upon which nerves have been affected), and photophobia<sup>51</sup>.
        </p>

        <div class="keypoint">
            Visual disturbance is one of the most commonly reported symptoms in MS, and it 
            is the presenting symptom in 25–50% of cases.
        </div>

        <p>
            Optic neuritis is the most common ocular disorder in MS. The effects of optic neuritis 
            are visual disturbance and ocular pain. 70% of people with MS will experience optic neuritis 
            during the course of their disease. Like MS itself, it normally affects people aged between 
            20 and 40 years, affects women more than men, and usually occurs in one eye rather than 
            bilaterally<sup>52</sup>. Not everyone who experiences optic neuritis goes on to develop 
            further symptoms of MS, but a significant proportion do<sup>53</sup>.
        </p>

        <div class="centeredimage">

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            Optic neuritis is characterised by dimmed vision with acute pain on eye movement, a consequence 
            of which is blurred, incomplete or jumping vision. It may be accompanied by nystagmus (rapid eye 
            movements). This is usually horizontal but may also be rotary, upbeating and downbeating.
        </p>

        <p>
            Optic neuritis is usually transient and associated with good recovery. It occurs suddenly, is 
            progressive and usually reaches its peak after about two weeks. Visual recovery takes from 4 to 
            6 weeks, but colour vision can be severely impaired with other minor defects often persisting. 
            Above all, loss of colour vision is a typical indication of MS; it develops if the optic nerve 
            is inflamed in the region around the central retina section, which is the area responsible for 
            seeing in colour<sup>1</sup>.

        <h3>3.3.4 Tremor</h3>

        <p>
            Approximately one third of people with MS have tremor. It is one of the most disabling symptoms 
            of MS, causing the person to become dependent as many daily activities become difficult to perform, 
            e.g., writing, eating, dressing and personal hygiene. People with severe tremor have a high level 
            of disability and a loss of independence in activities of daily living. A survey undertaken as part 
            of the European TREMOR study, found that people with MS who had moderate-to-severe tremor were unable 
            to continue in their employment and had to either give up or greatly modify their leisure activities. 
            Commonly, a person tries to cope with tremor either by 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup3"> avoidance of movements</a>, by 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup4"> compensation strategies </a>            
            or by adaptation of their external environment.
        </p>

        <div class="keypoint">
            Approximately one third of people with MS have tremor.  People with severe tremor have a high 
            level of disability and a loss of independence in activities of daily living.
        </div>

        <div id="deepdivepopup3" class="deepdivepopup">
            <b>Avoidance of movements:</b> Tremor can be socially isolating. The person with tremor will 
            often avoid movements that make their difficulties obvious. For example, many will refrain 
            from eating or drinking in public.
        </div>

        <div id="deepdivepopup4" class="deepdivepopup">
            <b>Compensation strategies:</b> By using strategies such as pressing the elbow firmly to the 
            side of the trunk, a person may find that their distal tremor is diminished and they are better 
            able to perform movements of  the hand even although they will have a shorter arm reach as a 
            result. Those with head tremor  (titubation) may attempt to stabilise the head against the 
            shoulder in an attempt to reduce the tremor. Retracting the shoulder girdle and pressing it 
            against the back of the chair, or   fixing the elbow in a locked straight position, may give 
            improved distal control.
        </div>

        <p>
            Tremor in MS can affect the limbs, trunk, vision and speech. It has been described as the most 
            frustrating MS symptom to treat<sup>54</sup>. Stress and anxiety can exacerbate tremor. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In MS, the two most prevalent tremor forms are postural tremor and intention tremor.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span><b>Postural tremor</b> is present while a position is voluntarily maintained against gravity. 
                        This type of tremor is common in people with MS and may include titubation of the 
                        head and neck.</span></li>
            <li><span><b>Intention tremor</b> is obvious when a movement is target-directed with an increased 
                        amplitude during visually guided movements towards the target. This can be observed during 
                        the finger-to-nose test when the person is asked to lift their arm out to the side, then to 
                        bend their elbow and touch their nose with their index finger<sup>55</sup>: As the finger approaches 
                        the nose the tremor amplitude increases. Intention tremor is related to lesions in the cerebellum 
                        and/or connected pathways in the brain stem and the term is often synonymously used with 
                        'cerebellar tremor'<sup>56</sup>.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Resting tremor, which is observed when a body part is not voluntarily activated and 
            supported against gravity, is unusual in MS<sup>57</sup>.

        <h3>3.3.5 Bladder Dysfunction</h3>

        <p>
            Approximately 75% of people with MS experience some type of bladder dysfunction during the 
            course of their disease. The effect of this can be difficult for the person, since bladder 
            control may deteriorate at the same time as mobility worsens, making it increasingly difficult 
            to respond to bladder urgency by hurrying to the toilet.

        <p class="figure">Table 2. Types of bladder dysfunction</p>

        <h3>
        3.3.5.1 Failure to Store (bladder overactivity)</h3>
        <p>
            Bladder overactivity is the problem that the person with MS is usually most aware of. 
            It is the most common type of bladder dysfunction in MS, with reported incidences ranging 
            from 26–50%. Symptoms of this dysfunction include urgency, frequency, urge incontinence 
            and nocturia<sup>59</sup>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It results in a tendency for the bladder to contract unpredictably and sometimes uncontrollably.
             At its worst, the bladder may seem to have 'a life of its own'. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After only partial filling the person senses urinary urgency. Incontinence may occur if the 
            contraction pressures are too high and the problem is made worse if mobility is affected and 
            it is difficult to reach the toilet in time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another feature of the impaired nerve supply to the bladder muscle is that the normal capacity 
            is diminished, causing urinary frequency. This increases the frequency of emptying from every 
            3–5 hours (depending on how much is drunk) to hourly or worse.
        </p>

        <h3>
        3.3.5.2 Failure to Empty</h3>

        <p>
            This type of bladder dysfunction is less common (incidence 19–40%) but it can result in more serious 
            complications than failure to store. Symptoms of failure to empty include frequency, nocturia, retention, 
            overflow incontinence and urinary tract infections. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Although some people with MS are aware that their bladders do not empty properly, others with the same 
            problem are not. For many, needing to void again soon after doing so is an indicator that bladder 
            emptying is poor. Research has shown that if people with MS thought they were not emptying their 
            bladder properly, they were usually correct. However, of those who thought they were 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup5">emptying completely</a>, 
            about half were wrong and were surprised to find how much urine they had been leaving behind<sup>60</sup>. 
        </p>

        <div id="deepdivepopup5" class="deepdivepopup">
            Incomplete bladder emptying is the result of two things going wrong, both of which are 
            due to spinal cord malfunction<sup>61</sup>:
            <ul>
                <li><span>
                        <b>detrusor–sphincter dyssynergia:</b> the muscle that surrounds the bladder outlet tube 
                        (urethral sphincter) does not relax when the bladder muscle contracts, but instead goes 
                        into contraction, thus causing an interrupted flow.
                </span></li>
                <li><span>
                        <b>detrusor hyperreflexia</b> with poorly sustained contractions: the neural impulses 
                        which in health keep the bladder muscle contracting until it is completely empty do not 
                        get down the spinal cord. When the bladder does contract, the contractions, although 
                        frequent, are poorly sustained.
                </span></li>

        </div>


        <h3>
            3.3.5.3 Combination Failure to Store and Failure to Empty</h3>
        <p>
            This occurs in 24–46% of people with bladder dysfunction in MS. It is often associated with 
            detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. Symptoms of this type of bladder dysfunction include those 
            associated with both failure to store and failure to empty<sup>62</sup>. If not treated 
            appropriately, this condition can lead to recurrent urinary tract infections, urinary 
            reflux, hydronephrosis and, in extreme cases, renal failure.

        <h3>
            3.3.6 Bowel Dysfunction</h3>
        <p>
            Bowel problems are common among people with MS, although they are generally under reported 
            and neglected<sup>59</sup>. Wiesel and colleagues<sup>63</sup> reported that the prevalence of bowel 
            dysfunction in patients with MS is higher than in the general population (up to 70%)<sup>63</sup>. 
        </p>

        <div class="centeredimage">
            <div class="imagegroup">
                <img src="images/3_M2_ParkComorbidity_Photo.jpg" alt="A photo of a female about to enter a public convenience" 
                    title="A photo of a female about to enter a public convenience" />
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            Bowel dysfunction does not appear to be associated with the degree of disability; however, 
            it is associated with duration of MS<sup>64</sup>. It is a source of considerable ongoing distress 
            in many people with MS<sup>63</sup>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to control bowel actions, it is necessary to be aware of the need, or
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup6">'call to stool'.</a>  
        </p>


        <div id="deepdivepopup6" class="deepdivepopup">
            'Call to stool' awareness occurs when the faeces move into the rectum causing the rectum 
            to expand and send messages via the sensory pathways of the need to evacuate. At this point, 
            the finely tuned nerve endings of the rectum are able to differentiate between whether the 
            stool is solid, liquid or wind.
        </div>

        <p>        
            However in MS the messages are often either lost or incomplete, leaving a situation in 
            which it may be difficult to differentiate between the calls.
        </p>
        <p>
            The two main types of bowel dysfunction in MS are constipation and faecal incontinence, 
            which may coexist: 
        </p>

        <h3>
        3.3.6.1 Constipation</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup7">Constipation</a>  is defined as two or 
            fewer bowel movements per week and/or the use of suppositories, laxatives or enemas more 
            than once per week to promote bowel movements. It is estimated that in the general population 
            of Europe the mean value of the reported constipation rates is 17.1%<sup>65</sup>. Constipation occurs 
            in approximately 36–53% of people with MS.
        </p>


        <div id="deepdivepopup7" class="deepdivepopup">
            Factors that contribute to constipation include<sup>64</sup>:
            <ul>
                <li><span>neurologic changes</span></li>
                <li><span>lack of sensation in the rectal area</span></li>
                <li><span>weakened abdominal muscles</span></li>
                <li><span>lack of mobility and exercise</span></li>
                <li><span>insufficient fluid intake</span></li>
                <li><span>medications, particularly those used to treat urinary symptoms</span></li>
                <li><span>inadequate bowel routines, particularly the lack of a regular and relaxed time for elimination.</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>
        3.3.6.2 Faecal Incontinence</h3>

        <p>
            Faecal incontinence is defined as the involuntary passage of stool. In people with MS it 
            occurs in 25% once a week and in 51% less than once a month. Factors contributing to 
            faecal incontinence include constipation that causes rectal distension and overflow, 
            diminished rectal sensation, sphincter dysfunction, certain medications and diet<sup>64</sup>.
        </p>

        <h3>
            3.3.7 Sexual Problems</h3>
        <p>
            The private and intimate nature of issues relating to sexuality presents a challenge to both 
            people with MS and the healthcare professionals caring for them. Patients who are experiencing 
            sexual problems may be unaware of the extent to which these can be attributed to MS; whilst 
            others may be concerned about the potential impact of MS on their sexuality. It is important, 
            therefore, for nurses working with people diagnosed with MS to be alert to the varying needs 
            of patients for assessment, information and reassurance about sexuality and sexual matters.
        </p>

        <div class="centeredimage">

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            The incidence of sexual dysfunction in people with MS varies considerably between different 
            reports. A 2009 review reported that between 50% and 90% of men and 40% and 80% of women are 
            affected<sup>66</sup>. The most frequently reported symptoms in women are anorgasmia or hyporgasmia, 
            decreased vaginal lubrication and reduced libido, and men most frequently experience impotence or 
            erectile dysfunction (ED), ejaculatory and/or orgasmic dysfunction and reduced libido<sup>67,68</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The prevalence of sexual dysfunction is higher in MS than in other chronic diseases, and almost 
            five times higher than in the general population<sup>69,70</sup>. Such studies tend to focus on 
            physical problems and the total impact of a change in an individual’s sexuality is often overlooked. 
        </p>

        <div class="keypoint">
            Prevalence studies indicate that approximately 70% of people with MS experience changes in sexual function.   
        </div>

        <p>
            Sexual dysfunction is correlated with the presence of other disabilities, in particular bladder 
            and bowel symptoms, sensory disturbance of the genitalia, weakness of the pelvic floor and 
            spasticity<sup>67</sup>. The associated factors may be recognised as 'risk factors' and alert the 
            nurse to the possibility of sexual dysfunction. In common with other symptoms of MS, those of 
            sexual dysfunction can relapse and remit. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Sexual problems can be described as primary, secondary or tertiary<sup>71</sup>. People with MS 
            may experience dysfunctions at any of these phases. 
        </p>

        <h3>
        3.3.7.1 Primary Sexual Dysfunction</h3>

        <p>
            Primary sexual dysfunction occurs as a result of demyelinating lesions in the spinal cord and 
            brain that directly impair sexual feelings and/or response. Examples include:
        </p>

        <ul>            
            <li><span>decreased or absent libido</span></li>
            <li><span>altered genital sensations or paresthesias</span></li>
            <li><span>decreased or absent genital sensations</span></li>
            <li><span>decreased frequency or intensity of orgasms</span></li>
            <li><span>erectile dysfunction</span></li>
            <li><span>decreased vaginal lubrication or clitoral engorgement</span></li>
            <li><span>decreased vaginal muscle tone.</span></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3.3.7.2 Secondary Sexual Dysfunction</h3>

        <p>
            Secondary sexual dysfunction refers to changes in sexual function that result 
            indirectly from other MS symptoms or medical/pharmacological interventions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The following MS symptoms can interfere with sexual expression:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span>fatigue – interferes with interest, activity level and spontaneity</span></li>
            <li><span>spasticity – affects comfort and positioning</span></li>
            <li><span>non-genital sensory paresthesias – reduce comfort and pleasure</span></li>
            <li><span>weakness – interferes with sexual activity</span></li>
            <li><span>pain – reduces sexual activity and pleasure</span></li>
            <li><span>bladder/bowel dysfunction – causes anxiety and discomfort</span></li>
            <li><span>tremor – interferes with sexual activity</span></li>
            <li><span>cognitive impairment – affects attention and psychogenic stimulation.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The following medications can interfere with the sexual response:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
                        (SSRIs) for depression – can inhibit libido and orgasm.</span></li>
            <li><span>anticholinergic and antimuscarinic medications – reduce vaginal lubrication</span></li>
            <li><span>antispasticity medications – produce significant fatigue</span></li>
            <li><span>anti-seizure medications used to control pain or tremor – produce significant fatigue.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
        3.3.7.3 Tertiary Sexual Dysfunction</h3>

        <p>
            Tertiary sexual dysfunction refers to the psychological, social and cultural issues that 
            interfere with sexual feelings and/or response. Examples include:
        </p>

        <ul>   
            <li><span>"Disabled people aren't sexually attractive."</span></li>
            <li><span>"I can't be both a caregiver and a lover."</span></li>
            <li><span>"If I don’t like myself any more, how can I expect someone else to find me attractive?"</span></li>
            <li><span>"This isn’t the same person I married."</span></li>
            <li><span>“He/she doesn’t find me attractive now that I'm a burden.”</span></li>
            <li><span>"With everything else thats going on, sex is the last thing I care about right now."</span></li>
        </ul>


        <p>
            It is important to establish in which of these areas a sexual problem is presenting. The range of 
            potential interventions includes (but is not limited to) those which directly enhance sexual activity, 
            the pharmacological management of MS symptoms and counselling directed at self-image or improved 
            communication skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also important to remember that MS is a condition of young people who may wish to 
            be/remain sexually very active. It is important to consider that the level of physical 
            function or relationship is not relevant to desire for sexual fulfilment.

                What might be the right way to start talking about difficult/personal problems,

                Letting the person with MS know that problems with bowel, bladder and sexual function can be a 
                part of MS is often a reassuring way to start a conversation. It is helpful to discuss the role 
                the nervous system plays in each of the functions discussed and, if possible, provide diagrams 
                for illustration. Letting them know that they are not alone and that, in most cases there are 
                many ways to approach those problems, often relieves anxiety from the start. The nurse as a partner 
                with the patient and family can explore many options to manage MS symptoms. The nurse should also 
                explore other issues related to the symptoms. The female patient with sexual dysfunction may feel 
                it is not worth discussing, yet simple changes such as emptying the bladder before intercourse and 
                alternative positions are often helpful. The patient who has a solid relationship with the MS nurse 
                is in the best position to partner with the nurse to approach the sometimes complex problem of symptom 
                management.

        3.3.8 Speech Difficulties</h3>

        <p>
            At a physical level, MS can affect the production of speech, usually by delays in messages passing through 
            affected nerve pathways to the muscles involved in speech production. 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup8"> Symptoms </a>
            are variable and often relate to fatigue and stress levels. Some people with MS experience a mild reduction 
            in volume when tired or a slight slurring of speech at the end of the day. Others find their thoughts run 
            ahead of their words<sup>43</sup>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Speech disturbances have been shown to correlate with severity of demyelination and progressive disease, 
            but not with duration of illness, age or onset of MS<sup>72</sup>. Speech disturbance is uncommon in the initial 
            stage of MS and tends to occur as a later manifestation. Initially the speech disorder is mild and the 
            severity increases progressively with greater degree of neurological involvement; it is more pronounced 
            in individuals in whom the disease process involves a greater number of neurological systems.

             <p>
                <b>Imprecise articulation (dysarthria)</b> <br />
                Speech can be slow and slurred, with imprecise vowels and consonants, sudden breakdowns or excessive 
                length of sounds. These difficulties are caused by slowness and weakness of tongue movements, and to a 
                lesser extent, by difficulties related with movement of lips and jaw.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Voice abnormalities (dysphonia)</b><br />
                There are different types of voice disturbances: harshness, breathiness, hoarseness and a 
                strained-strangled voice. The voice intensity may be low and decrease with fatigue. In some 
                cases, the person can produce only short utterances. These disturbances are caused by abnormalities 
                of breathing and of the laryngeal system. Deficits in breathing may consist of poor breath support 
                and lack of breath control for speech. Deficits in the laryngeal system may be caused by hyper- or 
                hypofunction. Sometimes the voice has an excessive nasal resonance.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Abnormal speech melody (dysprosody)</b><br />
                The person with MS may show prosodic disturbances, such as slowness or excessive velocity; poor or 
                excessive pitch variation; and excessive variation of loudness. These disturbances are caused by 
                reduced breathing control, by laryngeal and articulatory dysfunction, or by poor co-ordination 
                between these components.
             </p>
        </div>


        <p>        
            It is difficult to determine the number of people who will experience speech and communication 
            difficulties with their MS. Various studies have reported incidences ranging from 44% to 77%<sup>73</sup>. 
            In a large group study of patients with MS, Hartelius and colleagues<sup>74</sup> found that 62% of the 
            group reported speech and voice impairments. The variation in the incidence depends on the 
            severity, duration and stage of disease progression.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dysarthrias are commonly associated with other symptoms caused by brain-stem lesions, such as 
            head tremor and incoordination of fine motor control. The following speech symptoms have been 
            reported in order of frequency of occurrence:
        </p>

        <ul>       
            <li><span>impaired loudness control </span></li>
            <li><span>voice harshness </span></li>
            <li><span>defective articulation </span></li>

        </ul>

        
        <p>        
            Research into the effects of speech therapy on people with MS indicates that therapy can be 
            beneficial. General advice may include reducing background noise before speaking, saying half 
            words on each breath, speaking slowly and facing listeners when speaking. Traditional speech 
            exercises may be beneficial if the problem is very mild (e.g., exercises to assist breathe 
            control for volume).

        3.3.9 Swallowing Difficulties</h3>
        <p>
            Since speech and 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup9"> swallowing </a>
            share the same anatomical structures and some physiological mechanisms, speech disorders can be 
            associated with swallowing disorders.
        </p>

        <div id="deepdivepopup9" class="deepdivepopup" >
            <p>
                Swallowing has been recognised as one of the most basic biological functions, but the real process 
                is by no means basic. The act of swallowing consists of 3 phases:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Oral</span></li>
                <li><span>Pharyngeal</span></li>
                <li><span>Oesophageal</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The oro-pharyngeal phases last no longer than 1.5 seconds but involve the coordination of no less 
                than 31 paired muscle groups<sup>73</sup>. Impairment to the neurological control of swallowing results in 
                dysphagia, and may lead to potentially serious effects on respiratory function, nutrition and QOL.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>            
            Swallowing disorders (dysphagia) has been reported in 34% of MS patients, with a significant correlation with pronounced              
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup10"> severity of illness</a>
            <sup>75,76</sup>. The disturbances usually involve oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing, although upper 
            oesophageal sphincter dysfunction has also been detected<sup>75</sup>. This can include difficulty chewing, pocketing food in the 
            cheek, drink dribbling from the mouth, and episodes of coughing/choking when eating or drinking. It is not unusual for 
            people with MS to deny swallowing difficulties, even when family members report concerns.
        </p>

        <div id="deepdivepopup10" class="deepdivepopup" >
            A recent study<sup>77</sup> found that people with MS with dysphagia had a significantly longer 
            disease duration (p=0.031) and more neurological impairment in cerebellar functional system (p=0.04) 
            when compared with non-dysphagic patients. Dysphagia was significantly more prevalent in people with 
            more neurological disability as measured by EDSS scores (p=0.04). These results emphasise the importance 
            of assessment and management of swallowing function in people with MS, particularly in those with 
            a high EDSS score, more severe cerebellar dysfunction and long disease duration.
        </div>


        <p>        
            Self-reports of chewing and swallowing problems generally increase as MS progresses; the incidence of 
            these problems is 65% in the most severely disabled patients<sup>78</sup>. Depending on the location and extent 
            of demyelination, swallowing disorders can relapse and remit along with MS exacerbations.
        </p>
        <p>
            A speech and language therapist will be able to assess adequacy of swallowing through manual assessment 
            and videofluoroscopy. Following assessment, the therapist will advise on posture, amounts and consistencies 
            of food, and eating environment. If swallowing is considered unsafe and recurrent chest infections or 
            marked weight loss develop, then alternative ways of feeding will be recommended, e.g., nasogastric 
            feeding or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding.

        3.3.10 Cognition</h3>
        <p>
            Cognitive problems can arise early in the course of MS, although the greater the disease duration and 
            severity, the more likely cognitive problems are to occur. As with physical symptoms, MS may affect some 
            cognitive functions while others are left intact. Cognitive symptoms can worsen during relapse and improve 
            during remission, but more commonly cognitive symptoms develop slowly and gradually.
        </p>

        <div class="centeredimage">

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            Approximately 50% of people with MS develop measurable cognitive deficits<sup>79-81</sup>. In 5–10%, 
            cognitive impairment interferes significantly with everyday activities, but it is rarely severe enough 
            to require institutionalised care. Cognitive impairment can occur in patients with little physical 
            disability, and is an independent predictor of subsequent impairment in work and social settings<sup>82</sup>. 
            It can cause difficulties in maintaining employment, performing activities of daily living, and 
            adhering to medication; cognitive impairment interferes with social interactions, strains family 
            relationships and causes significant emotional distress<sup>83</sup>.

        <div class="keypoint">
            Approximately 50% of people with MS develop measurable cognitive deficits.   
        </div>

        <p>        
            Cognitive impairment remains relatively mild for most people with MS<sup>84</sup>, but in a small proportion 
            (around 10%) it progresses further to resemble a form of subcortical dementia<sup>85</sup>. Cognitive impairment 
            tends to get slightly worse very gradually, and at an unpredictable pace, over many years. The rate 
            of change depends largely upon the degree of disease activity in the brain. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Some cognitive functions are more likely to be affected than others in people with MS. These include 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup11"> recent memory,</a>
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup12"> attention and concentration,</a>

            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup15"> visuospatial functions</a>
            and verbal fluency<sup>86,87</sup>. General intellect, long-term memory, conversational skill and 
            reading comprehension are most likely to remain intact. General language functions, routine social 
            skills and orientation to person, place and time are rarely significantly affected in MS (even when 
            cognitive impairment becomes severe overall), although some degree of mild word-finding difficulty 
            is common<sup>82</sup>.
        </p>

        <div id="deepdivepopup11" class="deepdivepopup">
            <b>Memory loss</b> is probably the commonest cognitive problem experienced by patients with MS. Apart 
            from the obvious difficulties presented by forgetfulness, memory loss also has implications in 
            terms of learning new skills.
        </div>
        <div id="deepdivepopup12" class="deepdivepopup">
            <b>Attention and concentration lapses</b> can also cause problems, especially when attention 
            needs to be divided between tasks.
        </div>
        <div id="deepdivepopup13" class="deepdivepopup">
            <b>Speed of information processing</b> can be affected. This is particularly noticeable when people 
            have to deal with information coming to them from different directions.
        </div>
        <div id="deepdivepopup14" class="deepdivepopup">
            <b>Reasoning and judgment</b>, including new learning, problem solving and behavioural regulation, 
            may also be impaired but, because of the subtle nature of reasoning, this problem is often much less obvious.
        </div>
        <div id="deepdivepopup15" class="deepdivepopup">
            <b>Visuo-spatial perception</b> is also sometimes impaired.
            Cognitive functions which are <i>less likely</i> to be affected by MS include language, remote knowledge, 
            'old knowing', previously learned motor skills (e.g., riding a bicycle) and long-term automatic social skills.
        </div>

        <p>
            There is a wide range of individual variation in the experience of cognitive impairments. Many people 
            with MS experience none. Others may experience impairment in one area only; whilst others may experience 
            a combination of the more common areas of impairment. Even mild cognitive impairment can have a 
            significant impact on a patient’s capacity to 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup16"> function in their daily lives</a>.

        <div id="deepdivepopup16" class="deepdivepopup">
            <p>    
                A significantly slowed speed of information processing has been linked with an increased risk 
                for car accidents, and also with a greater risk of misunderstanding what is been said, which 
                in turn can lead to an increase in interpersonal conflict.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even mildly reduced problem-solving and organising skills can have a great impact on a patient's ability 
                to successfully juggle the multiple competing demands on their time and energy each day, 
                such as maintaining a job, keeping up with after-school activities of their children, and managing 
                their own personal MS symptom care plans which might require scheduled fatigue- or toilet-breaks.

            Therefore, evaluation of cognitive functioning should be part of the ongoing neurological and 
            nursing assessment of people with MS<sup>88</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Motor, sensory and fatigue symptoms may also affect a person's cognitive functioning. Therefore, 
            these symptoms need to be taken into account when evaluating cognitive impairment. Emotional state 
            can also affect a person's cognitive functioning<sup>89</sup>.

        <p>
            Spasticity affects approximately three quarters of people with MS<sup>90</sup>. In a survey a third 
            of people with MS reported spasticity as either a moderate or the worst symptom they experience on a 
            daily basis<sup>91</sup>. Severity of spasticity was related to duration of MS, severity of disability, 
            number of relapses and worsening symptoms in recent months<sup>91</sup>. Spasticity negatively affects 
            daily activities in up to 44% of those who are affected by it<sup>32</sup>. It can worsen gait problems, 
            physical components of QOL, and bowel or bladder dysfunction<sup>32,92</sup>.

            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup17">Spasticity</a>
            is one component of the upper motor neurone syndrome that occurs as a result of acquired damage 
            to any part of the CNS, including the spinal cord. It has a range of effects, which can be 
            categorised into positive and negative features; most people will present with a combination 
            of the two<sup>93</sup>.
        </p>

        <div id="deepdivepopup17" class="deepdivepopup">        
            <b>Why does spasticity occur? </b>
            <p>
                The control and regulation of normal skeletal muscle activity involves a complex combination of 
                descending motor commands, reflexes and sensory feedback, both from the brain and spinal cord, 
                and from peripheral sensation. During normal movement, influences from the cerebral cortex, basal 
                ganglia, thalamus and cerebellum, travelling via upper motor neurones, adjust, reinforce and 
                regulate the lower motor neurone which connects directly via peripheral nerves to the muscle to 
                form smooth, coordinated muscle activity and maintenance of posture.
            </p>
            <p>
                In simple terms, spasticity occurs when there is damage to these descending upper motor neuron 
                tracts (e.g., a plaque in MS). This interrupts the regulation of spinal cord and lower motor 
                neurone activity. This can result in enhanced lower motor neurone activity and a consequent 
                increase in muscle activity, in response to peripheral stimuli (e.g., muscle stretch, a urinary 
                tract infection or pressure ulcer)<sup>94</sup>
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>        
            Spasticity includes active muscle spasms, muscular tightness, stiffness, inelasticity and weakness. 
            Muscle weakness is a frequent first presenting symptom of MS, and spasticity often compounds the weakness.  
            Dizziness, vertigo and numbness can also occur in MS and interfere with mobility<sup>32</sup>. It can decrease range 
            of motion, hinder the initiation or cessation of movement, cause pain, increase fatigue and provoke falls. 
            It is a major source of disability in the lower limbs<sup>90</sup>. People with MS may notice that certain movements 
            are accompanied by increasing rigidity. This often occurs in the morning or after being seated for a length 
            of time; the cramping improves after several minutes. In addition, spontaneous jerks or contractions of 
            the extremities can occur<sup>1</sup>.
        </p>        

        <h3>3.3.11.1 Consequences of Spasticity</h3>
        <p>
            Spasticity does not always cause discomfort or inconvenience for people with MS. The muscle stiffness 
            can compensate for weakness in some cases, and can assist activity that would not otherwise have been 
            possible, as well as assisting with some components of physiotherapy<sup>95</sup>. However, in most cases spasticity 
            does cause problems. The increased stiffness in the muscles consumes a great deal of energy, can hinder 
            coordination and exacerbate other MS symptoms such as fatigue.

        <p>
            Spasticity can affect physical activities such as walking, transferring, picking up objects, 
            washing, dressing and sexual activity. It can also have an emotional impact, on for example, 
            mood, self-image and motivation<sup>96-98</sup>. Safety in sitting and lying can also be compromised due 
            to spasms or persistent poor positioning which can lead to the development of contractures. 
            This can potentially lead to restricted community mobility and social isolation. Therefore, 
            the treatment of spasticity needs to be carefully selected and reviewed over time in order to 
            meet the individual's aims, and to promote and maintain function.

        <p>
            Pain can be difficult to cope with and those who experience it may also be more prone to poorer mental health. 
            Pain can lead to depression, and depression in turn may contribute to the experience of pain. The pain 
            experienced by people with MS can be either primary, a direct result of nerve damage, or secondary, due to 
            disability, for example low back pain from prolonged wheelchair use or poor posture<sup>43</sup>.
        </p>


        <p>
            A systematic review of pain in MS<sup>100</sup> differentiates between four distinct pain categories:

        <ul>
            <li><span>continuous central neuropathic pain (e.g., dysesthetic extremity pain)</span></li>
            <li><span>intermittent central neuropathic pain (e.g., trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte's sign)</span></li>
            <li><span>musculoskeletal pain (e.g., lower back pain, muscle spasms or pain relating to tonic spasms)</span></li>
            <li><span>mixed neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain (e.g. headache).</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            An additional source of pain derives from MS-specific drug therapies which, although not serious, 
            may decrease compliance with treatment<sup>102</sup>.

            Neuropathic pain, or 'nerve pain', is usually described as burning, shooting, tingling, 
            stabbing and/or hypersensitivity. People with MS often experience neuropathic pain due to 
            demyelination of the nerves and plaques in the brain and spinal cord. An example of this 
            is <i>trigeminal neuralgia</i>, a severe facial pain, which occurs 300 times more frequently in 
            people with MS than in the general population. In extreme cases, surgery may be performed 
            to alleviate the pain of trigeminal neuralgia, but this may leave the face numb<sup>103</sup>. 
            Lhermitte's sign is another example of neuropathic pain often triggered by head movement and 
            attributed to demyelination in the cervical area.

            3.3.12.2 Nociceptive Pain</h3>

        <p>            
            Musculoskeletal or nociceptive pain is the type of pain experienced when damage occurs to muscles, 
            tendons, ligaments and soft tissue. Muscle spasm and spasticity, common symptoms of MS, can also be 
            a source of nociceptive pain. Many people with MS experience lower back pain, especially if 
            immobility or fatigue means that they are sitting down for much of the time. Sitting places the 
            lower back under more strain than standing and nerves can easily become compressed or pinched. 
            Equally, an alteration of gait may place unusual stresses on the discs between the vertebrae. 
            Such stress can cause damage to the discs and nerves to be trapped, which results in pain in whichever 
            part of the body is served by those nerves. Ligament damage can also occur in MS because of hyperextension 
            of the knee when walking; the subsequent swelling of the knee can cause significant pain<sup>101</sup>.

            3.3.13 Altered Mobility and Balance</h3>
        <p>
            Mobility can be defined as the ability to move freely; it includes moving in bed, getting out of bed, 
            moving into and out of chairs, going up and down stairs and slopes, getting to and from shops and using 
            public transport. It may also include endurance – some people with MS may retain the ability to walk 
            but can do so only over a short distance.

        </div>

        <p>
            Mobility is impaired in up to 90% of people with MS<sup>32</sup>. Impaired mobility affects functional 
            activity, employment, independence, and physical and mental components of QOL<sup>32</sup>. Several studies 
            have suggested the importance of mobility to productivity and employment. Mobility and hand function are 
            the two largest predictors of leaving the workforce. Of factors affecting QOL in a group of patients with 
            MS, 65% gave mobility the highest priority<sup>32</sup>. In another survey, 70% of people with MS and walking 
            impairment reported that it was the biggest challenge associated with MS<sup>104</sup>. Patient fear about

        <div id="deepdivepopup18" class="deepdivepopup">
             People with MS who are afraid of falling may decrease physical activity, which can reduce strength, endurance, 
             and range of motion<sup>105</sup>.  This can in turn increase the risk of falling, which may lead to additional 
             increase in medical costs.

        <p>
            Gait problems can appear any time in the disease course. Fifteen years after diagnosis the probability of 
            requiring assistance for walking is estimated at 40%, and of requiring a wheelchair, 25%<sup>32</sup>.

            3.3.14 Depression</h3>
        <p>
            Major, or clinical, depression is a serious psychiatric disorder that is distinguished from minor depression, 
            discouragement and grief by the persistence, severity and number of symptoms<sup>106</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A diagnosis of major depression requires an individual to have a sad or irritable mood most of the day and 
            nearly every day for at least two weeks. In addition, there must be four other 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup19">symptoms</a> 
            present during this time, which may include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span>loss of interest in the things one is usually interested in and capable of doing</span></li>
            <li><span>feelings of worthlessness or excessive/inappropriate guilt</span></li>
            <li><span>significant increase or decrease in appetite with weight gain or loss</span></li>
            <li><span>change in sleep patterns (waking up 2–3 hours earlier than usual, or </span></li>
            <li><span>increase in number of hours of sleep each day, by several hours or more)</span></li>
            <li><span>recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal feelings and thoughts, fatigue</span></li>
            <li><span>attentional impairment </span></li>
            <li><span>sexual dysfunction.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <div id="deepdivepopup19" class="deepdivepopup">
             Some of the symptoms associated with major depression are also associated with MS. Consequently, it's 
             important to differentiate between social withdrawal associated with depression (due to loss of interest 
             in usual social activities) and the inability to socialise in one's usual manner due to MS symptoms or 
             impairments. If the persistent and severe mood changes that characterise major depression are not present, 
             such symptoms are most likely due to MS.
        </div>
        
        <p>
            Major depression is more common in MS patients than in the general population, or even among people with 
            other chronic disabling diseases<sup>107</sup>. Half of all people with MS experience depression at some point in the 
            course of their illness<sup>108</sup>. The prevalence of major depression has been estimated at 26% in those in the 
            18–45 age range<sup>107</sup>. Depression may be a reaction to effects of MS, a result of lesions in areas of 
            the brain that control emotions, a result of immunologic processes in MS, a side effect of MS medications 
            (e.g., corticosteroids, possibly interferon), or may be a separate comorbidity.

        <p>
            Depression, which often goes unrecognised and untreated, does not correlate with level of disability in 
            MS<sup>109,110</sup>. It has however been shown to correlate with the degree of neurological impairment; 
            people with MS and depression tend to have a higher lesion load in the medial orbital frontal cortex than 
            non-depressed people with MS<sup>111</sup>. Depression has also been found to be the most important predictor of a 
            decreased QOL in MS patients<sup>112</sup>.
        </p>


        <p>  
            The uncertainty of the future, coupled with the perceived loss of a 'normal' life, causes most people with 
            MS to feel depressed at least occasionally. Researchers believe that MS-related depression may be due to a 
            combination of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>psychological reactions to the diagnosis of a chronic illness</span></li>
            <li><span>neuropathology of the disease process</span></li>
            <li><span>anxiety related to the uncertainty of future events</span></li>
            <li><span>grieving over the perceived loss of former self</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p> 
            Few diseases are as affected by emotional status as MS. Research has shown, for example, that function 
            and performance are much better when people are in good emotional health than when they are depressed 
            or anxious<sup>113</sup>.
        </p>
        <p> 
            The presentation of depression in people with MS frequently differs from that of the general population. 
            In MS, symptoms such as sadness, irritability and anxiety may be the first indicators of an underlying 
            depression. In any person with MS who is depressed, a list of possible contributing factors (such as 
            chronic pain and social isolation) should be drawn up. Interventions should be undertaken to help resolve 
            those contributing factors where possible. Specific antidepressant medication or psychological treatments 
            such as cognitive behavioural therapy should be considered, but only as part of an overall programme of 
            depression management.
