			<ul>
                <li><span>Multiple sclerosis (MS) usually starts with an acute episode of neurological disturbance.</span></li>
                <li><span>There are four types of disease course, defined as relapsing/remitting MS, secondary-progressive MS, primary-progressive MS and progressive-relapsing MS.</span></li>
                <li><span>MS is associated with a number of symptoms, including vision difficulties, speaking and swallowing difficulties, weakness, pain, tremors, bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction, thinking and memory problems, depression, fatigue and episodic symptoms. </span></li>
                <li><span>These symptoms may affect a patient’s functioning and wellbeing. </span></li>
                <li><span>Treatment of symptoms may improve quality of life and day-to-day functional ability. </span></li>
                <li><span>However, symptomatic treatments do not slow progression of the disease.</span></li>
                <li><span>Relapses are common and caused by inflammatory activity within the central nervous system. </span></li>
                <li><span>They are classed as fairly acute episodes, defined by an increase in symptoms lasting at least 24–48 hours occurring after a period of stability of at least 30 days. </span></li>
                <li><span>The extent of recovery from relapse and the duration of any given relapse are difficult to predict and this understandably causes a great deal of anxiety. </span></li>
                <li><span>The role of the MS Nurse in assessing the nature of the problem and providing information and support to patients and their families is key. </span></li>
                <li><span>The MS Nurse is also important in ruling out any other possible causes of an exacerbation of symptoms, such as an infection which may require treating in its own right.</span></li>
                <li><span>There are a number of different forms in which MS can present, which although less common, are still important to be aware of.</span></li>
                <li><span>MS can present in young children and the older adult, and therefore should be considered as a possible diagnosis in these groups of patients</span></li>
                <li><span>A number of prognostic factors have been identified that help predict likelihood of  long-term disability</span></li>
                <li><span>None of the factors described have been validated as reliable for predicting the course of an individual patient</span></li>
                <li><span>It is reasonable to expect that the more negative prognostic factors a patient has, the higher the risk of a worse long-term outcome.</span></li>
                <li><span>This information may help clinicians identify patients for whom MS is more likely to take a more disabling course.</span></li>
