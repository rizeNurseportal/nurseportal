        <h2>5.4  Late Onset</h2>
        <p>        
            Although there is no general consensus, MS is currently said to be 'late onset' (LOMS) if the first 
            symptoms of the disease present after 50 years of age<sup>131</sup>. The diagnosis and clinical management of 
            LOMS is confusing, given that there are several different diseases that can present similar symptoms, 
            including ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, the frequency of which increases with age, and cervical 
            myelopathy of spondyloarthritic origin, considered to be the number one cause of paraesthesia over 
            the age of 50 years<sup>132</sup>.

            Advanced age is no longer considered to be a diagnostic exclusion criterion for MS. A case has been 
            published of a female patient who was 82 years of age when she presented with her first symptom of 
            MS<sup>133</sup>. In some publications, the term 'very late onset' has been used to refer to cases 
            in which the disease presents in the seventh decade of life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Primary-progressive MS (PPMS) predominates in LOMS, affecting 55–80% of these individuals<sup>131,134</sup>, 
            although disease progression appears similar to those with adult-onset MS<sup>134</sup>. However, it has recently 
            been reported that women with LOMS have a different trajectory in terms of disease progression than women 
            with adult-onset MS<sup>135</sup>. Vigilance is necessary to recognise MS in this population because of 
            its unusual presentation<sup>131</sup>.
