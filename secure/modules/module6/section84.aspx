        <h2>8.4 Work based adaptations or accommodations</h2>

        <p>
            Many PwMS can work successfully if some adaptations or <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup2">accommodations</a> are put in place in the work environment (Table 10). These may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Procedural modifications (schedule, tasks, supervisory style, workplace tools)</span></li>
            <li><span>Physical environment modifications</span></li>
            <li><span>Technical equipment (e.g. voice-activated software)</span></li>

        </ul>
         <div id="deepdivepopup2" class="deepdivepopup">
                <p>
                 An accommodation is a modification to the work environment or to the way an essential job function is performed. The purpose of the 
                    accommodation is to allow an otherwise qualified person to enter or to continue in employment by removing or reducing significant 
                    disability-related work limitations.</p>

        <p>The MSIF survey explored what factors would help PwMS remain in work (figure 9)<sup>256</sup>. The most popular factors were flexible working hours (37%) and 
            resting time during work breaks (33%). Having help with childcare was more likely to be selected by women and people aged 31 to 40.</p>

        <p>combinations of accommodations are often required to help maintain employment. A recent study found that 73% of PwMS reported using one or more 
            accommodations<sup>269</sup>. The number of accommodations ranged from 0 to 18, with a median number of 2.0 accommodations (figure 10).</p>

        </div>

        <p>Accommodations for some of the more common barriers are described below.</p>
        <h3><i>Fatigue and cognition</i></h3>
        <p>The combination of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms of MS can have a detrimen¬tal effect on PwMS employment, with fatigue being a 
            particularly impactful symptom<sup>270</sup>. A number of adaptations can be incorporated to facilitate work activities<sup>271,272</sup>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span><b>Schedule modifications</b> are common workplace accommodations implemented on behalf of PwMS. For those with predictable fatigue, it may be 
                possible to modify the work schedule so that the employee can engage in tasks demanding more physical and cognitive effort in the morning. </span></li>
            <li><span><b>Built in rest time</b>, if frequent enough, can help stop the development of more significant fatigue. Splitting the day with a two-hour break in 
                the middle to accommodate a longer rest period might be necessary. Also, for some people with heat sensitivity, climate control may reduce fatigue.</span></li>
            <li><span><b>Working at home</b> can be helpful since the process of getting to and from work requires signifi¬cant energy. Many PwMS report that if they can work 
                for a portion of the workday or workweek from home, they are more pro¬ductive and less fatigued.</span></li>
            <li><span>Increasing the <b>structure</b> and <b>predictability</b> of the work environment can help PwMS with cognitive changes. <b>Memory books</b> or <b>computer calendars</b> 
                can help with memory problems. </span></li>
            <li><span><b>Developing routines</b> helps to focus cognitive energy on specific tasks. <b>Restricting distractions</b> will be important, so a private office, 
                acoustical and/or visual screening, or segmenting time away from answering telephones may help. </span></li>

        </ul>
        <h3><i>Motor weakness</i></h3>
        <p>An <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup3">ergonomic</a> work envi¬ronment is an important first step in the accom¬modation process to address 
            motor weakness. </p>
        <div id="deepdivepopup3" class="deepdivepopup">
                <p>
                 Ergonomics is a science concerned with the ‘fit’ between people and their work. It puts people first, taking account of their capabilities and limitations. 
                    Ergonomics aims to make sure that tasks, equipment, information and the environment fit each worker.</p>
              </div>
          <ul>
            <li><span>The PwMS should be <b>properly positioned</b> in their seat to minimise pain and fatigue. Adjustable workstations are now available that allow the keyboard, 
                mouse, and monitor to be positioned independently. </span></li>
            <li><span>Adaptive writing instruments can be used to steady a hand in order to account for ataxia and tremor. </span></li>
            <li><span>Keyboard typing aids can help if gripping strength is reduced. Large-key keyboards, touch pads, an ergonomic mouse, use of a joystick 
                and voice recognition software are all adaptive interventions that can be applied in the work environment.</span></li>
          
        </ul>
        <h3><i>Mobility</i></h3>
        <ul><li><span>Positioning the workstation to require the least amount of walking can help. The workstation can be located nearer to the entrance, toilets, 
            key meeting spaces, or closer to a parking spot, as needed. For PwMS with significant mobility demands, a scooter or power chair can facilitate travel 
            within the workplace.</span></li></ul>
        <h3><i>Vision</i></h3>
        <ul><li><span>Accommodating vision changes requires input from a specialist. High quality computer monitors with good contrast provide a good foundation 
            for a com¬puter station. Screen enlargement software can be useful. For PwMS with difficulty reading print materials, a closed-circuit TV (CCTV) can 
            be used to enhance the contrast and size of print. Various fixed and move¬able lenses can allow people to magnify their work. </span></li></ul>
        <h3><i>8.4.1	Assessing the workplace</i></h3>
        <p>PwMS require a full assessment of actual and potential factors that impact upon the workplace. This requires a coordinated approach, with the focus on 
            producing the best outcome for the PwMS. Employers, healthcare professionals, trade unions, HR professionals, line managers and occupational safety 
            and health practitioners must all work together to create a powerful multidisciplinary team to help make sure that reasonable adjustments are identified 
            which are both appropriate and without risk; to support and ensure the implementation of such adjustments; and to monitor their ongoing impact and 
            effectiveness.</p>

            <p><i>By integrating conversations about work as a routine part of clinical consultations with PwMS, potential work difficulties can be identified 
                and early action taken to address them. Preventing people falling out of work in the first place is crucial in reducing longer term harm. It is 
                better to support PwMS to stay in a job than it is for them to experience job loss and have to seek new employment.</i></p>
