        <h2>3.6 Rehabilitation for progressive MS
        </h2>

        <p>
            After a variable period, the relapsing-remitting course may proceed to a slowly progressive phase, often without any relapses (secondary progressive, SPMS). 
            A minority of patients (10%) will suffer a primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) course from disease onset, usually characterised by a slow 
            increase of symptoms and disabilities. There is a strong evidence base for rehabilitative interventions for the treatment of people with RRMS but the 
            evidence base for effective rehabilitative treatments for people with progressive MS is more limited . This is largely due to the high levels of 
            disability and activity restrictions associated with progressive forms of the disease. 
        </p>
        <p>There is evidence that several types of physiotherapy interventions yield beneficial results for progressive MS patients. These include (but are not limited to):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Functional electrical stimulation<sup>71</sup> </span></li>
            <li><span>Exercise therapy<sup>72</sup> </span></li>
            <li><span>A combination of botulinum toxin type A injections and manual stretches<sup>73</sup> </span></li>
            <li><span>Inspiratory muscle training<sup>74</sup> </span></li>
            <li><span>Body weight supported treadmill training and robotic orthotics<sup>75</sup> </span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There is promising evidence for the efficacy of MDR for people with progressive MS. Two studies adopting a 6-week MDR programme found improvements in 
            disability when measured using the Functional Independence Measure<sup>76,77,78</sup>. Improvements were also found in depression, social experience, QoL and fatigue and these were maintained at six weeks post intervention. This highlights the importance of rehabilitation for all PwMS, not just 
            those with a relapsing course. It can be that, because those with a primary progressive course are often not treated with a DMT and are therefore 
            not seen regularly in clinic, these PwMS can get lost in the system. It is important to check that people with a primary progressive course are 
            monitored to ensure they are getting suitable referrals to the multidisciplinary team.

                <i>It is important to consider that someone living with PPMS may be as aspirational as someone with RRMS. It is more effective to think about the 
                individual rather than the medical label, and to focus on what matters to them, what is realistically achievable and relevant. Rehabilitation for 
                PwPPMS may involve a wider range of individuals as there is likely to be higher level of dependency over time. It is important to keep everyone fully 
                informed, engaged and skilled in supporting rehabilitation interventions.</i>

            Cognitive changes are a common symptom of MS – more than half of all PwMS will develop problems with cognition. A 2013 study examining the variability 
            in cognitive defects among patients with PPMS and RRMS found that cognitive deficits were more severe in patients with PPMS compared to RRMS patients<sup>79</sup>. 
            They found that PPMS patients experienced a wide range of cognitive deficits including:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span>Information processing speed</span></li>
            <li><span>Attention </span></li>
            <li><span>Working memory</span></li>
            <li><span>Executive function </span></li>
            <li><span>Verbal episodic memory</span></li>
        </ul>

            Cognitive rehabilitation therapy is a non-pharmacological method of improving a specific cognitive skill through practice and training. As the brain is a 
            dynamic, 
            adaptable organ, repetitive practicing of a specific cognitive task will strengthen communication between the neurons required for that task. Cognitive 
            rehabilitation should therefore be a central component of a MDR strategy; especially for individuals with progressive MS phenotypes. Some of the cognitive 
            rehabilitation techniques that can be utilised during a treatment plan are summarised below (Table 3).

        <p>The efficacy of different cognitive rehabilitative interventions for PwMS varies<sup>80</sup> with some of the most efficacious, evidence based techniques being:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span>Computer assisted programmes targeting attention and memory<sup>81,82</sup></span></li>
            <li><span>Using memory notebooks for consolidating information<sup>83</sup></span></li>
            <li><span>Using story memory techniques for verbal learning and improving memory<sup>84</sup> </span></li>
        </ul>

            Research has highlighted that physical activity affects cognition in some PwMS. Reported benefits of yoga in PwMS populations include reduced fatigue 
            and improved attention<sup>85</sup>. A 2011 study demonstrated a positive correlation between physical activity and cognitive processing speed in 
            ambulatory PwMS<sup>86</sup>. Whilst definite conclusions cannot be drawn from these studies, the positive association between physical activity and 
            cognitive function suggests that physical activity might be an efficacious non-pharmacological treatment for cognitive impairment in MS and as such, should be encouraged.
