        <p>
            Internalised negative appraisal of the capacity to manage life with MS can affect emotional and behavioural responses to ongoing treatment and 
            rehabilitation. Counselling provides the space to safely explore these feelings and responses, and discover positive ways to manage life with MS.

           Being referred to a counsellor when I was first under my neurorehabilitation team was a really crucial and essential part of my rehabilitation. 
            Counselling is talked about a lot in terms of depression but I wasn't depressed. I just had a lot of things to come to terms with. I don't think my 
            rehabilitation would have been so successful if it wasn't for the simultaneous counselling.

        <p>Voluntary work can provide social contribution, interaction and recognition of experience/expertise and may be therapeutic employment or in addition to paid work.</p>
       
        <div class="keypoint">
           Voluntary work is really important to me and has been absolutely crucial for my mental health. I probably wouldn't have paid as much attention to 
            changing physical needs if it wasn't for my voluntary work.
