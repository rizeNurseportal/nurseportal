        <h2>5.3 Restrictions in activity and participation due to fatigue</h2>
        <h3><i>5.3.1 Background</i></h3>
        <p>
            The etiology, clinical presentation and management of fatigue is <b>outlined in modules 2 and 4</b>. In this section, the emphasis is on different types 
            of rehabilitation interventions for alleviating fatigue.  
        </p>
        <p>In the past, it was believed that physical activity worsens fatigue and PwMS were told to rest frequently to alleviate fatigue<sup>141</sup>. 
            Evidence now indicates that exercise is safe and can contribute to lessening fatigue<sup>142</sup>. Fatigue rehabilitation should be multidimensional, 
            involving several members of the MDR team<sup>143</sup>.</p>
        <p>Non-pharmacological interventions appear to have a stronger and more significant effect on reducing fatigue relative to pharmacological treatments<sup>144</sup>. 
            In 2016 the Treating Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis (TREFAMS)<sup>145</sup> research programme found that, relative to aerobic training (AT) and energy 
            conservation management (ECM), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the most efficacious form of rehabilitation for reducing MS-related fatigue. 
            Rehabilitation should therefore be the initial treatment choice for PwMS who are reporting activity limiting fatigue. Regardless of the TREFAMS study, 
            ECM and exercise still have roles during rehabilitation for MS-related fatigue. </p>
    <h3><i>5.3.2 Assessment </i></h3>
        <p>There are a number of generic and disease-specific self-reported questionnaires available for assessing fatigue<sup>146</sup>. Following a review of different 
            outcome measures for assessing fatigue, the Unidimensional Fatigue Impact Scale (U-FIS)<sup>147</sup> and the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive 
            functions (FSMC)<sup>148</sup> were recommended. The <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1">Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)</a> is however, still the most widely used assessment instrument 
            for fatigue<sup>149</sup>. In addition, the <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup2">Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS)</a> is also frequently used to reflect the multidimensionality of MS 
            related fatigue<sup>150,151</sup>. It should be noted that fatigue scales are “subjective” and partly depend on a person’s mood and motivation. </p>

         <div id="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdivepopup">
                <p>
                    The FSS was designed to investigate the connection between fatigue intensity and functional disability. The FSS consists of nine questions, 
                    uses a 7-point scale ranging from strongly disagrees to strongly agree. The scores from each question are totalled with lower scores indicating 
                    less fatigue in everyday life. The total score for the FSS is calculated as the average of the individual item responses.
                </p>
            </div>

         <div id="deepdivepopup2" class="deepdivepopup">
                <p>
                    The MFIS questionnaire provides an indication of the impact fatigue has on an individual in three domains: physical, cognitive, and psychosocial. 
                    Higher scores indicate that fatigue has a greater impact on the individual.  
                </p>
            </div>
        <h3><i>5.3.3 Rehabilitation: Exercise interventions</i></h3>
        <p>The evidence for exercise interventions in alleviating MS-related fatigue is somewhat mixed. A recent review concluded that exercise interventions have 
            only a moderate effect on reducing fatigue in PwMS<sup>152</sup>. The study authors also concluded that no specific type of exercise intervention was 
            more efficacious than others for alleviating fatigue<sup>151</sup>. In contrast, a different review concluded that some exercise therapies, either endurance, 
            mixed (i.e., endurance and resistance), or alternative training (e.g., yoga), may reduce fatigue in PwMS<sup>153,154</sup>.</p>

        <p>Despite the benefits of exercise, the extent of the intervention effects varies. Exercise interventions may be non-applicable for older PwMS or 
            those with certain progressive MS phenotypes and/or severe disability<sup>155</sup>.</p>
        <h3><i>Progressive resistance training (PRT)</i></h3>
        <p>The benefits of PRT in reducing the adverse effects of fatigue will generally be more applicable in early stages of the disease, but it is not a widely used 
            rehabilitative method for MS-related fatigue. Despite this, there is some evidence that supports its efficacy. PwMS participating in a PRT programme 
            utilising leg presses, knee extensions, calf raises, leg curls and reverse leg presses over a 10-week period, reported positive changes in self-reported 
            fatigue using the MFIS<sup>156</sup>.</p>
        <p>Similarly, fatigue, mood and QoL all improved in PwMS using PRT<sup>157</sup>. The programme consisted of a warm up on a stationary bike, followed by 5 different resistance 
            based exercises. The effects of these interventions were still evident 12 weeks after completing the programme. </p>
        <h3>Endurance training</h3>
        <p>There is moderate evidence supporting endurance-based exercise training for alleviating fatigue in PwMS<sup>158,159</sup>.The evidence indicates that training at a moderate intensity for 
            longer durations provides better results compared to high intensity/low duration endurance training<sup>160</sup>.</p>
        <p>Sabapathy et al. (2010) used an endurance training programme involving a circuit of 8 different exercise stations (each comprising of 6 different activities) 
            to assess the efficacy of PRT vs endurance training in improving several functional and QoL measures, including fatigue. Using the MFIS, they noted a 
            reduction in MFIS scores in PwMS participating in both endurance training and PRT<sup>161</sup>. </p>
        <p>The types of endurance focused rehabilitative exercises for fatigue management can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Step ups   </span></li>
            <li><span>Arm cranking	</span></li>
            <li><span>Recumbent cycling</span></li>
            <li><span>Treadmill walking       </span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Practical indicators used to determine the intensity of endurance training are the target heart rate, and the level of perceived exertion<sup>162</sup>. </p>
       
        <p>A typical rehabilitative, endurance training intervention should consist of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>A 5-minute warm-up, at low intensity, to allow the cardiopulmonary system to adjust to the new demand </span></li>
            <li><span>A ‘work’ phase, with the duration adjusted according to and depending on the targeted frequency, or a PwMS’ perceived exertion</span></li>
            <li><span>A low intensity cool-down to prevent blood pooling, and to promote the clearance of lactic acid<sup>163</sup>  </span></li>
           
        </ul>
        <p>Recommendations on endurance training in PwMS are generally in accordance with those for healthy adults<sup>164</sup>. Increasing training intensity should be 
            carefully monitored and adjusted depending on an individual’s capacity.</p>
        <h3><i>5.3.5 Educational interventions</i></h3>
        <p>Education interventions in the form of courses on ECM have proved to be effective therapy for fatigue - PwMS who participated in an ECM had lower levels of 
            fatigue compared to non-participating MS patients<sup>165</sup>. The ECM rehabilitation consisted of six weeks of highly structured, two-hour group 
            sessions<sup>166</sup> which focused on:  </p>
         <ul>
            <li><span>The importance of rest throughout the day</span></li>
            <li><span>Positive and effective communication</span></li>
            <li><span>Proper body mechanics 	</span></li>
            <li><span>Ergonomics principles</span></li>
             <li><span>Modification of environment	</span></li>
            <li><span>Activity analysis and modification	</span></li>
            <li><span>Living a balanced lifestyle</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>ECM is generally beneficial in the short-term for reducing the impact of fatigue<sup>167</sup>. The efficacy of ECM for MS-related fatigue is not 
            universal - a 2017 clinical trial found that ECM did not reduce MS-related fatigue or restrictions in participation compared to PwMS in 
            control groups<sup>168</sup>. More randomised controlled trials examining ECM over the long-term are required.</p>
        <h3><i>5.3.6 Cognitive behaviour therapy</i></h3>
        <p>Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and relaxation training (RT) are clinically effective interventions for fatigue in PwMS<sup>169</sup>. CBT 
            for MS-related fatigue aims to influence the dysfunctional cognitions, behaviours, and emotions that perpetuate fatigue. Therapists will 
            challenge the meaning of dysfunctional cognitions and aim to change the behaviours of patients with MS-related fatigue and emphasise 
            more realistic cognitions, emotions, and behaviours<sup>170</sup>.  </p>
        <p>CBT interventions would usually be delivered over several months and may consist of several modules (individualised for a patient 
            following a baseline consultation) such as<sup>171</sup>:</p>
         <ul>
            <li><span>Formulating goals	</span></li>
            <li><span>Regulating sleep/wake pattern      </span></li>
            <li><span>Changing beliefs about MS</span></li>
            <li><span>Changing beliefs about fatigue      </span></li>
             <li><span>Reduce focus on fatigue</span></li>
            <li><span>Regulation of physical activity</span></li>
            <li><span>Regulation of social activity</span></li>
              <li><span>Regulation of mental activity</span></li>
            <li><span>Addressing the role of environment</span></li>
            <li><span>Handling pain</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>A 2017 study demonstrated that CBT interventions delivered via face-to-face sessions over 16 weeks by CBT therapists had significant, 
            positive effects on treating and decreasing MS-related fatigue1<sup>171</sup>. Face-to-face sessions may not always be an option for various 
            reasons including the lack of trained therapists, financial costs and limited local health resources. By using the Internet and 
            smartphones, there is now potential to deliver CBT (and many other health related services) using mobile phone 
            technologies<sup>172,173</sup>. It would be beneficial for the MS Nurse/MDR team to keep up-to-date on the development/release of any 
            relevant apps or software that may benefit rehabilitation for PwMS.   </p>
        <h3><i>5.3.7 Other interventions</i></h3>
        <p>Evidence indicates that <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup3">aquatic exercise training</a> can improve MS associated fatigue<sup>174</sup>. 
            The buoyant nature and viscosity of water facilitate physical activities for PwMS with a physical weakness. Aquatic exercise three 
            times/week over 8 weeks demonstrated substantial reductions in fatigue levels (measured using MFIS) as well as sub-scores of 
            health-related QoL after 4 and 8 weeks<sup>173</sup>. </p>
        <div id="deepdivepopup3" class="deepdivepopup">
                <p>
                   Training should include warm-up and cool-down periods performed in the pool, and should consist of low-intensity aerobic 
                    exercises such as breathing exercises with flexibility, walking, and neck, arm, and leg movements. 
                </p>
            <p>Exercises used during an aquatic exercise study for MS-related fatigue will generally include activities focused:</p>
             <ul>
            <li><span>on joint mobility,</span></li>
            <li><span>flexor and extensor muscle strength </span></li>
            <li><span>balance movements </span></li>
            <li><span>posture</span></li>
             <li><span>functional activities </span></li>
                 <li><span>intermittent walking</span></li>
                 </ul>
