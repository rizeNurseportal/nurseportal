            3.3 Rehabilitation following diagnosis 
        </h2>
        <p>
           There may be a decrease in well-being and activity following diagnosis and symptom amplification may negatively affect response shift. Rehabilitative 
            interventions following an MS diagnosis can therefore be largely information based<sup>50</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>By providing PwMS with well-informed advice about their disease management they will be in a better position to: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Gain adeptness over their disability </span></li>
             <li><span>Maximise their potential for independence and self-care</span></li>
             <li><span>Improve employment sustainability </span></li>
             <li><span>Reduce the impact the disease has on HRQoL</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Behavioural change interventions have been successfully trialled in people with a variety of long-term conditions and health 
            concerns<sup>51,52,53</sup>. In MS, promoting the adoption of self-care behaviours can lead to improved well-being, increased activity participation 
            and better symptom management<sup>54,56</sup>. Such self-care interventions can include stress management techniques, fatigue management, appropriate 
            exercise, and proper nutrition.</p>
        <p>Adopting such behaviours early in the disease trajectory can bring about a better physical, psychological, and social adjustment to MS; the greatest 
            potential for central nervous system adaptation and recovery occurs in the early stages of the disease<sup>56</sup>. Physical interventions performed shortly 
            after diagnosis may delay the occurrence of further problems such as: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Musculoskeletal pain from abnormal gait patterns </span></li>
             <li><span>Injuries from falling</span></li>
             <li><span>Muscle deconditioning </span></li>
             <li><span>Weakness and fatigue associated with decreased activity<sup>57</sup></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Information and access to appropriate treatment and disease management, especially concerning relapse management and immunotherapy, is of vital 
            importance in the months following diagnosis.</p>
