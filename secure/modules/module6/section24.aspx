                <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1"><b><i>Restorative rehabilitation</i></b></a> is primarily focused on restoring any loss in physical and/or cognitive functionality and it is aimed at bringing a PwMS 
                to their highest functioning potential; its goals are specific, and can be readily measured<sup>29</sup>. The success of restorative rehabilitation is measured 
                in terms of return to function of abilities to perform specific tasks. Restorative rehabilitation can include: 
            </p>
            <ul class="noindent">
                <li><span>Coaching on muscle strength, balance, etc to improve safe transfer methods</span></li>
                <li><span>Coaching of exercise programmes designed to improve physical fitness and range of motion (potentially leading to improved mobility)</span></li>
                <li><span>Assistance in re-establishing social connections in the community – e.g., improvement of voice strength (by speech and language therapist) or interaction skills (by psychologist or occupational therapist)</span></li>
                <li><span>Regaining skills, mobility, confidence and practical support to perform tasks associated with everyday living </span></li>
                           </ul>
        </div>

                Restorative rehabilitation is designed to help an individual reach their highest physical and functional level given the limitations imposed by the 
                disease. It is important for PwMS who have experienced a relapse of MS symptoms and the accompanying decrease in functional abilities. Restorative 
                rehabilitation interventions will then be aimed to restore as much as possible of the PwMS’s earlier functionality. An example is hand dexterity 
                coaching to regain functionality in order to perform an everyday task such as closing buttons on an item of clothing.               
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>The restorative goal should always be to maximise independence, productivity, comfort, and self-care, which may have been diminished following a relapse, 
            whilst minimising the impact of the impairment and any secondary complications on the PwMS’ activities and levels of participation<sup>34</sup>.</p>
        <p>Compensatory techniques may be utilised if restorative approaches fail. Restoration and compensation are generally considered to be distinctly 
            different phases in rehabilitation. Despite this, compensatory rehabilitation can be used as part of a preventative rehabilitative programme, to stop further symptom degradation. For example, utilising assistive or adaptive devices such as walking frames, crutches and canes, to compensate for gait dysfunctions, muscle weakness and/or fatigue, can be beneficial for maintaining muscle strength and therefore help to prevent further reductions in mobility. </p>

            <p>
                Loss of function may bring a sense of bereavement or fear, and may also dismantle any denial strategy that has been used by the PwMS; particularly after a second or subsequent relapse. It is important to talk about these reactions and acknowledge fear, sadness or sense of loss before any restorative programme begins. There may be a reluctance to disclose such feelings for fear of compromising treatments.
