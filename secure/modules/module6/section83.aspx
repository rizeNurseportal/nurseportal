        <h3><i>8.3.1	Disease-related factors</i></h3>
        <p>
           The whole range of disease-related symptoms experienced by PwMS can serve as barriers to maintaining employment (Table 9). Many of these barriers are discreet, complex and difficult to articulate.

        <p>In the recent employment study by the MSIF, fatigue was the most common factor preventing PwMS from staying in employment (figure 7 and 8)<sup>255</sup>. 
            Women and PwMS aged 31 to 40 were more likely to highlight a lack of childcare support as a problem. Not having support from their own family 
            was mentioned more often by PwMS aged over 60. </p>
        <p>
           Similarly, another study<sup>260</sup> found that for those PwMS who left work as a result of their MS, the most common reasons given were related to MS symptoms, particularly 
        </p>
         <ul>
                <li><span>Fatigue</span></li>
                <li><span>Problems with legs, feet, arms or hands</span></li>
                  <li><span>Difficulty with memory, concentration or thinking</span></li>
                <li><span>Balance or dizziness</span></li>
              <li><span>Heat sensitivity </span></li>
            </ul>

        <p>More specifically, regarding cognitive problems, scores on tests of processing speed, verbal fluency, working memory, and long-term memory 
            are typically lower in unemployed versus employed PwMS<sup>261,262,263</sup>.</p>

        <p>Another predictor of employment is condition severity/progression which can impact upon:</p>

        <ul>
                <li><span>Physical disability including mobility limitation, making access to work and movement within the workplace difficult</span></li>
                <li><span>Dexterity affecting handwriting, keyboard use and other manual tasks</span></li>
                  <li><span>Visual impairment resulting in difficulty with reading</span></li>
               
            </ul>
        <p>Workplace performance can be compromised by the unpredictable nature of MS:</p>
        <ul>
                <li><span>Symptoms are discreet, complex or invisible with their impact poorly understood<sup>264</sup></span></li>
                <li><span>It can be difficult for an employer to understand when a PwMS will “look the same but not feel or function in the same way”</span></li>
                  <li><span>Flexibility and adaptability in the workplace that aligns to the capacity of the PwMS is a key support component</span></li>
               
            </ul>
        <h3><i>8.3.2	Other factors</i></h3>
        <p>Several demographic factors have also been found to be associated with employment status in MS including disease duration, course type, age, 
            years of education, sex, and general disability<sup>265,266,267</sup>. The employment environment itself can also provide barriers for PwMS (figure 8). 
            Specific issues can include difficulties travelling to and from work, and access while at work (e.g., physical obstacles, wheelchair 
            access, inaccessible toilet, inflexible work patterns)<sup>268</sup>. </p>

            <p><i>For many PwMS it is the commute to work and back, rather than the work place itself, that is challenging. It is helpful for the therapist 
                to have knowledge of the options and resources available that will enable the PwMS to commute with minimum effort. This will facilitate a 
                less stressful work time and a more relaxed leisure time.</i></p>
