        <h2>7.5 Sexual dysfunction</h2>
        <h3>7.5.1	Background</h3>
        <p>Changes in sexual function and/or responsiveness are common in MS, and can occur as an early symptom of the disease. It is important to raise the 
            issue at the time of diagnosis and revisit the subject as often as necessary. <b>See module 4 and 5 for more information regarding the treatment 
                of sexual problems in MS.</b></p>
        <h3><i>7.5.2	Rehabilitation</i></h3>
        <p>
            Managing sexual dysfunction starts with a mutual sharing of knowledge and information. Redefining sexual intimacy as well as 
            promoting better intimacy, and promoting better communications around sexual issues, are key to success.  
        </p>
        <p>The MDR team has a key role in addressing the medical and psychological issues related to self-esteem, such as negatively altered body image and 
            diminished sexual confidence. Talking with PwMS about their sexual issues may bring considerable benefits and reinforce the therapeutic alliance 
            between patient and healthcare professional. Whenever possible, PwMS must be referred to a specialist for more specific treatments or counselling 
            (e.g. with a sexual health psychologist). Interventions in the form of education and developing coping strategies can be provided as rehabilitation. 
            Other important interventions include diagnosing and treating mood disorders, as well as tailoring pharmacological treatments such that they interfere 
            as little as possible with sexual functioning<sup>243</sup>.</p>
        <p>In females with MS, weakness of the pelvic floor and bladder and bowel dysfunction are correlated with changes in lubrication and orgasmic 
            capacity<sup>244</sup>. Spasticity, impaired mobility and coordination, fatigue, pain, and numbness are other factors that affect 
            satisfactory intercourse<sup>245</sup>. Rehabilitative interventions should address inhibitory factors of sexual health with an emphasis on 
            alleviating spasticity and muscle spasms and advising in correct body positioning. Pelvic floor exercises (e.g. Kegel) may enhance orgasmic 
            response and prevent accidental excretion. </p>
        <p>Rehabilitation for sexual health can be largely information based. Advanced planning of any sexual activity should be stressed. For example, 
            advise a PwMS to plan sexual activity in the morning, when fatigue is minimal; choose a position which demands minimal effort; and administer 
            anti-spasticity medications one hour before planned activity (if required).</p>
        <p>Besides managing specific MS symptoms that contribute to sexual issues, a Sex -Therapist may advise on the intercourse–outercourse approach<sup>246</sup>. 
            Outercourse is lovemaking without penetration. It allows a couple to be sexual without having sexual intercourse. Through genital rubbing, oral 
            stimulation of genitals or manual stimulation, each partner can reach orgasm or stop at a lower level of pleasure and enjoyment. A Sex Therapist 
            can offer PwMS and their partners special training based on the concept of sexual flexibility. </p>
        <p>Men may have difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection (the most common problem), reduced sensation in the penis and difficulty achieving 
            ejaculation. Erectile dysfunction may be addressed through various oral medications (<b>see module 4 for more information</b>). </p>
