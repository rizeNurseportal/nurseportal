               The MS Nurse is a supportive presence throughout the person’s experience of living with MS; providing comprehensive, evidence-based information, responding to questions, clarifying (translating) communications to and from the physician, navigating to useful resources, and ensuring that the person with MS is a self-determined participant in his or her own care. The information and on-going support provided by the nurse is key in enabling the individuals’ ability to make, share and agree with the goals of the multidisciplinary team.
