        <h2>5.2 Activities of daily living</h2>

        <div>
            <p>
                Rehabilitation plays a key part in ensuring safety and independence during activities of daily living. Accurately identifying symptoms linked to activity limitations and participation restrictions will allow the MDR team to better address modifiable factors. 
            </p>
        </div>

             <p>
          Activities of daily living (ADLs) are essential to independent living. They are grouped into two categories (table 4):
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><span>Basic ADLs (BADLs) or personal ADLs (PADLs) are those things that are considered fundamental to taking care of ourselves.</span></li>
            <li><span>Instrumental ADLs (IADLs) are those activities that may affect our ability to live on our own but are not necessary for personal daily functioning. IADLs require more complex cognitive functioning than PADLs.</span></li>
        </ol>

        </div>
        <p>The primary objectives of rehabilitation for managing daily life are to enable PwMS to: </p>
        <ul><li><span>Participate in self-care, work and leisure activities</span></li>
                <li><span>Optimise personal fulfilment, well-being and QoL</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>PwMS and healthcare providers work together to ascertain if there are limitations in the life domains that are important to them (Figure 6); 
                strategies can then be put in place to address these.</p>

        <h3><i>5.2.1	Evaluation of ADLs</i></h3>
        <p>Following diagnosis, occupational therapists work in collaboration with other members of the MDR and the PwMS to promote independence in all life domains 
            and to manage and maintain meaningful activities. Joint evaluation with the PwMS is the first step in the occupational therapy programme. This involves 
            assessing performance skills in ADLs, including strength testing, range of motion, motor assessment, vision screening, sensation, and cognition; sharing 
            personal goals; assessment of home and work environments (section 7.6). A shared evaluation of need and modification within the home environment will 
            provide valuable information unavailable within a healthcare setting. The assessment includes an evaluation of the current functional status of the PwMS 
            in relation to the performance of ADLs. </p>
        <p>There are many assessment tools available; each tool has strengths and limitations in terms of characteristics and content. Some instruments screen for 
            potential restrictions while others provide detailed and in-depth information to guide goal setting and treatment planning. 
            Instruments vary in their approach to data collection; some use self-report while others involve objective evaluation of actual performance. 
            The process of selecting the assessment(s) to use must be informed by the situation of the PwMS and the purpose of the data generated. Table 5 provides 
            additional details regarding some of the assessment tools available.</p>

        <div class="centeredimage">
            <div class="imagegroup">
                <img src="images/11_M6.png" alt="Activities of daily living " class="zoomable"/>
                
            </div>
            <p class="figure"><B>Table 5:</B> Examples of daily life assessments </p>
            
        </div>
        <p>Activities are typically scored by the level of assistance that the PwMS requires to complete the activities. Once evaluation is complete, the occupational 
            therapist and the PwMS make a unique programme using a combination of techniques.</p>
        <h3><i>5.2.2	Coaching</i></h3>
        <p>The occupational therapist will facilitate skills required for living well at a physical, mental or social capacity; when a PwMS identifies problems in 
            preparing food, the coaching will take place in the kitchen. When physical, mental or social resources cannot meet the need of the task, the occupational 
            therapist may advise alternative strategies to compensate for the limitations (compensatory strategies); if standing for a length of time is not possible 
            due to muscle weakness, the PwMS may use a chair to perform the task. Occupational therapists may also advise modified or assistive devices or 
            house alterations (see section 7.5) to engage in occupations adequately (e.g., thicker knife, inclination of a mirror, communication boards, 
            wheelchair use indoor and outdoor). Coaching in the use of suitable equipment is required.</p>
<p>Caregivers or family members can help facilitate agreed interventions, including an understanding of the level of supervision required to complete ADLs. 
    This can ensure the PwMS remains independent and safe. The caregiver can be coached to provide a lightness of touch that is enabling, empowering and open 
    to opportunity for the PwMS.</p>

        <h3>5.2.3	Assisted living aids and home modifications</h3>
        <p>Many modern housing options do not respond to the changing/fluctuating needs of people with chronic, progressive conditions such as MS, yet homes need to 
            adapt to support the PwMS. Home modifications can be changes or adaptations to support optimum living and accessibility. Adaptive equipment, assistive 
            devices, and splints or other positioning devices are recommended to aid PwMS in completing their ADLs.</p>
        <p>Research indicates that PwMS are isolated when home accessibility is a challenge<sup>140</sup>. PwMS can experience changes to their homes (removing furniture and 
            installing ramps), as “institution-like”. Home must not be the place where a person feels most disabled and the final decision on agreeing, and utilising, 
            modifications must remain with the PwMS.</p>

        <h3><i>5.2.4	Assessing the home environment</i></h3>
        <p>A team approach, with the PwMS at the heart of the team, is the optimum way to determine long-term needs and best options for home modifications. 
            Home adaptations and technical and mobility aids should be planned and assessed in close collaboration with the occupational therapist, taking into 
            account any financial implications and expectations of the PwMS and their families. </p>
        <p>Assessment approaches include validated screening tools, interviews, observation, and validated performance indicators (Table 6). Each of these 
            assessment methods has strengths and limits to their application.</p>
         <div class="nursetip">
            <a href="#" class="nursetipicon">click here</a>
            <p><i>When assessing the home environment for adaptation remember that it will be home to others (unless the PwMS lives alone), and sensitivity is 
                needed to ensure other occupants are able to enjoy a normal home environment as much as possible. If they are also a carer it is important that 
                they have sanctuary for privacy and peace. Be mindful that there may be anxiety, even resentment at having to have a home adapted. Encourage open 
                discussion that will enable feelings to be acknowledged and worked through.</i>

            <p class="figure"><B>Table 6:</B> Assessment approaches for the home environment</p>
            
        </div>
        <p>It is beneficial for the PwMS to be given the opportunity to trial the equipment during treatment sessions to ensure that the equipment is functionally, 
            cognitively and emotionally relevant and acceptable.  </p>
        <h3><i>5.2.5	Examples of modifications and adaptive devices</i></h3>
        <p>Some of the more challenging activities in the home are outlined in table 7, along with examples of modifications that can be made. </p>
          <div class="centeredimage">
            <div class="imagegroup">
                <img src="images/13_M6.png" alt="Examples of home-based modifications" class="zoomable"/>
                
            </div>
            <p class="figure"><B>Table 7:</B> Examples of home-based modifications</p>
            
        </div>
        <p>Some of the more common examples of adaptive devices are outlined in table 8.</p>
         <div class="centeredimage">
            <div class="imagegroup">
                <img src="images/14_M6.png" alt="Examples of adaptive devices" class="zoomable"/>
                
            </div>
            <p class="figure"><B>Table 8:</B> Examples of adaptive devices</p>
            
        </div>
        <p>Home modifications designed to address mobility issues must optimise the resources and personal attributes of the PwMS and consider safety when 
            moving around the home or in the community. Continuation of usual activities is important and many modifications reflect this:</p>
        <ul><li><span>Kitchen modifications that enable PwMS to cook etc </span></li>
            <li><span>Stair lifts for accessibility </span></li>
            <li><span>Shower chair for independent bathing</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>As the disease progresses, the environmental barriers can change and therefore, regular assessment and evaluation is important.</p>
        <p>The prevention of injuries or falls is critical and requires assessment of individual need, risk, and contextual factors. The occupational 
            therapist may advise a bath chair, grab rails and slip mats for safe bathing/personal hygiene. Improving lighting in driveways and hallways 
            can reduce accident risk. The use of a walking aid may also contribute to reduce the risk of falls, or a thermostatic tap may be useful to prevent 
            burning injuries.</p>
