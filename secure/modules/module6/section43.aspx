                <li><span>The effect of MS on body structures and functions varies from person to person; rehabilitation will need to be personalised to the needs of each PwMS.</span></li>
                <li><span>Body structure impairments need to be separately assessed and interventions developed for each one.</span></li>
                <li><span>There are various forms of rehabilitation for impaired mobility; exercise should be encouraged from diagnosis.</span></li>
                <li><span>Upper limb functionality should be regularly assessed – maintaining functionality should be a high priority for the MDR team.</span></li>
                <li><span>Physiotherapy for ataxia/tremor generally consists of interventions focusing on posture and balance, core stability as well as exercise programmes which act to increase muscle movements.</span></li>
                <li><span>Rehabilitation for muscle weakness generally involves individualised exercise programmes which aim to increase muscle strength but also build endurance.</span></li>
                <li><span>Bladder dysfunction rehabilitation will vary according to MS trajectory.</span></li>
                <li><span>Establishing a regular voiding pattern and controlling fibre intake important initial steps during a bowel training programme.</span></li>
                <li><span>Ability to identify the symptoms of a swallowing problem is essential for advising on specific interventions. </span></li>

            How do you determine the impact that MS has on physical functioning of your PwMS? What assessments do you perform to confirm this and how do you build a 
            rehabilitative programme together to address the issues?
