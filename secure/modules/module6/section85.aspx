        <h2>8.5 Outcome measures for employment rehabilitation</h2>
        <p>
            Rehabilitation outcomes are the benefits and changes in the functioning of an individual over time that are attributable to a single measure or 
            set of measures<sup>273</sup>. Traditionally, rehabilitation outcome measures focused on individual impairment level, but are now inclusive of individual 
            activity and participation outcomes<sup>274,275</sup>. These assess the PwMS’s performance across a range of areas including work and employment. Examples 
            include the return-to-work rates. There is no single outcome measure for vocational rehabilitation, but a selection of measures which can be 
            used as appropriate:

                <li><span>Work productivity and Activity Limitation Questionnaire</span></li>
                <li><span>Work Limitations Questionnaire</span></li>
                <li><span>MS Work Instability Scale</span></li>

                <li><span>Self Report Barthel</span></li>
                <li><span>Occupational Wellbeing Questionnaire</span></li>
                <li><span>MSWS12 (MS Walking Scale)</span></li>
                <li><span>MSIS (MS Impact Scale)</span></li>
                <li><span>SF36 (Short Form Health Survey)</span></li>
                <li><span>GHQ (General Health Questionnaire)</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>There is limited evidence of benefit from specific services or interventions. A Cochrane review  highlighted two studies:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Job retention using a counselling approach, </span></li>
                <li><span>Job seeking using support delivered by telephone.</span></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Neither study demonstrated any benefit; however, demonstrating that PwMS have retained jobs they might have lost is challenging</p>
            <p>A review of research undertaken in vocational rehabilitation for PwMS<sup>277</sup> highlighted five themes that are common when describing effective vocational rehabilitation:</p>
       <ol>
                <li><span>The need for a multidisciplinary team</span></li>
                <li><span>Early intervention with a responsive service</span></li>
           <li><span>Ability to support work performance</span></li>
                <li><span>Liaison with employers</span></li>
           <li><span>Education and support to re-enter the workplace.</span></li>
            </ol>
