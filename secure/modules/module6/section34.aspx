            3.4 Rehabilitation after a relapse 
        </h2>    
        <p>
            Treatment of MS relapses is directed towards shortening the duration of a relapse and promoting recovery. This has typically been accomplished 
            pharmacologically, generally using corticosteroids – intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) is the most typical (see module 4 section X). Utilising 
            rehabilitation during a relapse can help PwMS achieve a more complete functional status over the long-term. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation (MDR) 
            in combination with corticosteroid therapy is known to improve patient outcomes<sup>58</sup>. 
        </p>
        <p>A UK based clinical trial compared the outcomes of therapy in PwMS experiencing a relapse who participated in a MDR programme in combination with 
            receiving IVMP, vs. a control group, also receiving IVMP but whose rehabilitation was limited to a standard ward-based, recovery programme<sup>59</sup>. 
            The group randomised to receive MDR and corticosteroids had statistically significant better outcomes in a range of measures assessing cognitive 
            and physical functionality as well as general health after three months compared to the control group.</p>
        <p>This outcome is comparable to a US study by Bethoux<sup>60</sup>. The pattern of recovery in PwMS who were treated with IVMP after an MS relapse 
            indicated that IVMP had only a modest effect on participants’ subjective symptom severity and perceived health status. This was despite 
            significant reductions in outcome measures for assessing impairments and disability. The authors recommended that rehabilitation interventions may be 
            more effective in reducing subjective disease burden and could be used in combination with high-dose corticosteroids for managing acute symptom 
            relapses. Rehabilitation should be encouraged in addition to pharmacological interventions to aid in relapse recovery.</p>

        <p>Following a relapse, the goal of rehabilitation is to return as close as possible to baseline functioning. However, a wait of several weeks may be 
            appropriate before physical therapy commences because of weakness, side effects from medications and other factors e.g., pain, vision problems, numbness. 
            Once a PwMS is able to participate in rehabilitation, physical therapy should be directed at: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Normalising tone<sup>61</sup>  </span></li>
             <li><span>Improving movement </span></li>
             <li><span>Refining posture </span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>By focusing rehabilitation on muscle tone, movement and posture during corticosteroid therapy, and throughout the acute period afterwards, rehabilitation 
            can contribute in facilitating an improved longer term functional outcome. It can also aid in the restoration of lost or diminished abilities; this is 
            referred to as restorative rehabilitation, the aim of which is to maintain functionality and restore any lost abilities by gradually returning a PwMS 
            to their former level of activity. In restorative rehabilitation, the emphasis will be on alleviating any exacerbated symptoms that have not subsided 
            and if needed, coaching in the use of adaptive aids as these may help regain previous functionality. Restorative interventions can include: </p>
        <ul><li><span>Exercise programmes focusing on restoring</span>
            <ul>
                <li><span>stability</span></li>
                <li><span>balance</span></li>
                <li><span>fitness</span></li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span>The provision of mobility aids</span></li>
            <li><span>Health education</span></li>
            <li><span>Assessment for the provision of orthotics</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, restorative rehabilitation administered in the form of occupational therapy after a relapse may include:</p>
         <ul><li><span>Provision of supportive equipment for the home such as hand-rails and grips to help with weakness but which also aid muscle strength restoration </span></li>
            <li><span>Fatigue and stress management education</span></li>
            <li><span>Referral to social services for more long-term home assessments if required</span></li>
        </ul>
