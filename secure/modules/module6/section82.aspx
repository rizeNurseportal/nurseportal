              <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup2">Work is fundamental to social integration</a>; it provides income, self-worth (paid and unpaid work), self-determination and independence, 
                showcases skills and abilities and (maybe most importantly) a network of friendships and relationships.

                 Being in work has considerable benefits, not just for individuals but also for their families and for the communities in which they live. We know 
                    that being in work is generally good for people’s health and wellbeing, and that being out of work leads to poorer health and increases health 
                    inequalities. Helping people to remain in or quickly return to work when health conditions arise is therefore important. With changing demographics, 
                    it is not just important for individuals, but essential if we are to create a sustainable workforce for the dynamic economy that supports an 
                    increasingly ageing population.</p>
              </div>
            <p>MS has an adverse effect on employment outcomes, and is accompanied by <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup3">high rates of unemployment and early retirement</a>. 75% of PwMS 
                declared that MS had impacted their employment and career opportunities<sup>249</sup>. The implications can be costly, both for the 
                economy and for the individuals themselves; PwMS lose an average of 18 working years due to their condition and are much more likely to 
                have a ‘below average’ household income compared to those without MS<sup>250</sup>. </p>
             <div id="deepdivepopup3" class="deepdivepopup">
                <p>
                 The reasons for this are often multi-faceted and complex. The reality is that many PwMS may be able to work and want to work, but are 
                    prevented from doing so by various cultural, attitudinal, and structural barriers. Identifying and addressing these barriers is paramount 
                    for both productivity and population wellbeing.</p>
              </div>
            <p>PwMS have high unemployment rates<sup>251</sup>; ranging from 70 to –80% being unemployed within 5 to –10 years of disease onset<sup>252</sup>. 
                Unemployment rates increase 
                with longer duration of MS<sup>253</sup>. While most people are employed at time of diagnosis and 90–96% have a work history, nearly half of PwMS leave work 
                and change to early retirement within 15 years of diagnosis<sup>254,255</sup>. A recent survey by the MSIF found that 43% of PwMS who were not working had 
                stopped work within 3 years of diagnosis<sup>256</sup>. This suggests that there could be a window in which an early intervention can be made to 
                stop 
                people leaving the workforce sooner than necessary.</p>
            <p>The mean retirement age found among PwMS across nine European countries ranged from 45 to 53 years – the lowest average age of 
                early retirement was found in Belgium and the highest in Austria<sup>257</sup>. </p>
            <p>Though unemployment rates for PwMS vary across studies and across countries, it is clear that they are much higher than unemployment rates of 
                the general population<sup>258</sup>. Nearly one-half of the unemployed PwMS would prefer to work if they could<sup>259</sup>.</p>

            <p><i>Work will not be the right outcome for all PwMS, but it should be recognised as an option for those who wish to work; even where they are 
                only at the start of a potentially long path. Healthcare professionals often have considerable influence on individuals’ decisions about what 
                their health means for their life. We must look at ways to improve understanding and recognition of the positive contribution that work can make 
                to the life of someone with MS, and support those who see work in their future to achieve it.</i></p>
