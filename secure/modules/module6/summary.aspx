            <ul>
                <li><span>Rehabilitation is an important component of care for the PwMS; however not all PwMS appreciate the positive impact rehabilitation can have and there are multiple barriers to the implementation of rehabilitation</span></li>
                <li><span>Rehabilitation for PwMS should involve a multidisciplinary approach to increase effectiveness of rehabilitative interventions; the PwMS is at the heart of the multidisciplinary team and central to all aspects of rehabilitative care. Family involvement is important</span></li>
                <li><span>The nurse is a consistent and supportive presence and their role in rehabilitation should not be underestimated</span></li>
                  <li><span>Rehabilitation can lower healthcare costs</span></li>

                <li><span>Goals should always be focused around the PwMS</span></li>
                <li><span>Goal planning should be the first step in designing any rehabilitation plan</span></li>
                <li><span>Goals should be regularly amended according to disease course and level of impairment a PwMS is experiencing</span></li>
                <li><span>Restorative goals – often the type of goals adopted after a relapse – should be designed to help PwMS achieve their highest functional level</span></li>
                <li><span>Goals should be realistic, according to a PwMS’ capacity; PwMS should not be set up to fail</span></li>
                <li><span>Goals should be designed using the SMART strategy and be measurable</span></li>
                <li><span>As many MDR team members as possible should be involved in the goal setting process</span></li>
                <li><span>Goals should be set according to the needs of PwMS at home or in their community</span></li>
                <li><span>The contribution of different forms of rehabilitation will vary across the MS trajectory</span></li>
                <li><span>Throughout the disease trajectory, rehabilitation should always focus on maintaining optimal levels of functional independence</span></li>
                <li><span>Providing education about MS is important following diagnosis</span></li>
                <li><span>Physical interventions, performed shortly after diagnosis, can improve patient outcomes following a relapse</span></li>
                <li><span>After a relapse, physical therapy should focus on normalising tone, improving movement and refining posture</span></li>
                <li><span>People with RRMS should consistently participate in an exercise programme</span></li>
                <li><span>Cognitive rehabilitation should be emphasised for progressive types of MS; both restorative and compensatory interventions should be encouraged</span></li>
                <li><span>The effect of MS on body structures and functions varies from person to person; rehabilitation will need to be personalised to the needs of each PwMS</span></li>
                <li><span>Body structure impairments need to be separately assessed and interventions developed for each one</span></li>
                <li><span>There are various forms of rehabilitation for impaired mobility; exercise should be encouraged from diagnosis</span></li>
                <li><span>Upper limb functionality should be regularly assessed – maintaining functionality should be a high priority for the MDR team</span></li>
                <li><span>Physiotherapy for ataxia/tremor generally consists of interventions focusing on posture and balance, core stability as well as exercise programmes which act to increase muscle movements</span></li>
                <li><span>Rehabilitation for muscle weakness generally involves individualised exercise programmes which aim to increase muscle strength but also build endurance</span></li>
                <li><span>Bladder dysfunction rehabilitation will vary according to MS trajectory</span></li>
                <li><span>Establishing a regular voiding pattern and controlling fiber intake important initial steps during a bowel training programme</span></li>
                <li><span>Ability to identify the symptoms of a swallowing problem is essential for advising on specific interventions </span></li>

                <li><span>MS has a major impact on day to day life and activities; these activities can be basic or instrumental</span></li>
                <li><span>The occupational therapist works closely with the PwMS, helping them to identify and address issues which impact their daily living</span></li>
                <li><span>Home modifications and adaptive equipment can be utilised to assist a PwMS to ensure they are able to perform daily activities </span></li>
                <li><span>Rehabilitation for MS-related fatigue can consist of exercise, ECM and CBT interventions</span></li>
                <li><span>Recent studies have found non-pharmacological interventions for treating MS-related fatigue to be efficacious in alleviating fatigue in PwMS; of these CBT has been found to be more beneficial than exercise and ECM</span></li>
                <li><span>Exercise interventions should not be disregarded. They have wide reaching impact on various aspects of MS rehabilitation including fatigue</span></li>
                <li><span>Endurance focused exercise interventions may be more efficacious than PRT for alleviating MS-related fatigue</span></li>
                <li><span>Speech and communication dysfunctions can lead to social isolation and depression; rehabilitation should begin as soon symptoms arise</span></li>
                <li><span>Programme setting is an integral aspect of programme development and must be compatible with programme aims and service user needs</span></li>
                <li><span>Home-based programmes offer unique opportunities for context-based practice and the integration of activities into real life</span></li>
                <li><span>Community-based programmes may provide greater motivational, peer, and facilitator support opportunities</span></li>
                <li><span>Depression has a significant effect in determining QoL – members of the MDR team should ask about depressive symptoms during routine appointments</span></li>
                <li><span>PwMS should be made aware of the various forms of counselling that may be available to them</span></li>
                <li><span>Use of alternate therapies and/or technologies which promote well-being and relaxation as well as engagement with other PwMS should be encouraged</span></li>
                <li><span>Members of the MDR team should regularly encourage PwMS to talk about any sexual problems early after their diagnosis</span></li>
                <li><span>The first step in rehabilitation for MS-related sexual health is ensuring a PwMS is sufficiently informed on the topic</span></li>

                <li><span>MS has a significant impact upon a PwMS’s career, with many leaving full-time employment early due to their MS. This can lead to low self-esteem and reduced QoL</span></li>
                <li><span>The whole range of disease-related symptoms experienced by PwMS can serve as barriers to maintaining employment; these include fatigue, cognition, motor weakness, vision</span></li>
                <li><span>There are a number of different adaptations that can be made to the work environment in order to accommodate a PwMS and enable them to continue working; these can be implemented after a full assessment of the environment has been made by a member of the MDR</span></li>
