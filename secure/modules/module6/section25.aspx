        <div>
            <p>
                Rehabilitation in a progressive disease such as MS often needs to be directed towards preventing further loss of function - this is referred to as 
                maintenance or <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1"><b><i>preventative rehabilitation</i></b></a> a PwMS may have achieved during restorative and compensatory rehabilitation.  

            </p>
            <div id="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdivepopup">
                <p>
                    Preventative rehabilitation is utilised to maintain the highest level of functionality an individual may have achieved during restorative rehabilitation. Its aim is to prevent any decrease in function.            
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>The overall goals of preventative rehabilitation are:</p>
            <ul class="noindent">
                <li><span>To keep ahead of disease progression by slowly adapting to any disability before, and as it occurs </span></li>
                <li><span>Preventing and/or easing secondary complications of MS such as decubitus ulcers, osteoporosis or muscle atrophy</span></li>
                <li><span>Prevent/account for any reduction in physical and/or cognitive functioning associated with progressive nature of MSy</span></li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                A preventative goal could be prolonging the use of crutches. Rehabilitation to reach this goal could be utilising cycle ergometry and progressive resistance 
                training; regular sessions can build arm and leg muscle strength<sup>35</sup> which will help the PwMS maintain muscular support.
