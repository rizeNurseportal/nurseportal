        <h2>8.6	Laws regarding the rights of PwMS in the workplace </h2>
        <p>
            When PwMS unwillingly withdraw from the workplace they cite lack of information about statutory rights, inflexible employment structures and 
            inadequate internal employer/colleague support/adaptation for job retention as reasons for that withdrawal. This has the potential to become active 
            discrimination. PwMS fear that disclosure of their condition might cause negative consequences for their employment or career<sup>278</sup>. Knowing the legal 
            protections available to workers with disabilities is an important factor in the long-term vocational success of a PwMS.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Equality Act 2010<sup>279</sup> replaced and extended the Disability Discrimination Act. This Act protects anyone who has been diagnosed with MS from the moment of diagnosis (whether or not they are currently 
            experiencing symptoms) against unfair treatment and discrimination in the workplace where this is related to their condition.
        </p>
        <p>The Equality Act gives PwMS the right not to be discriminated against:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span>When applying for a job – employers cannot ask a job applicant about their health unless and until the applicant has been offered a job</span></li>
            <li><span>In the way PwMS are treated by employers and colleagues</span></li>
            <li><span>In opportunities for training or promotion</span></li>
            <li><span>In being selected for redundancy</span></li>

        </ul>
        <p>
            The Equality Act does not protect a PwMS from disciplinary action for poor performance or inappropriate conduct. However, the employer must ensure 
            that the employee is not treated unfairly due to their disability. This means they have to consider whether the PwMS’s condition contributed to 
            the problem and what steps were taken to manage any difficulties that had been identified. Dismissal should only be considered after a full 
            exploration of <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup2">reasonable</a> adjustments in the workplace.
        </p>

        <div id="deepdivepopup2" class="deepdivepopup">
            <p>
                A reasonable adjustment or accommodation is a change, often to the job or the working environment, that enables the PwMS to continue to do their job. 
                    The PwMS has the right to ask for reasonable adjustments as a key part of the Equality Act. What is considered ‘reasonable’ will depend on the 
                    company and the job the PwMS does. Many reasonable adjustments cost little or nothing to put in place. Examples of reasonable adjustments that a 
                    Pw MS might ask for include: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>A chair or stool to sit on </span></li>
                <li><span>Flexible or reduced working hours</span></li>
                <li><span>Working from home</span></li>
                <li><span>Moving their work station away from a source of heat, or closer to a toilet </span></li>
                <li><span>Time off for medical appointments</span></li>
                <li><span>A car parking space near the entrance to work</span></li>
                <li><span>Voice recognition software, or an adapted keyboard or mouse</span></li>
                <li><span>Changes to the workplace layout to make it more accessible</span></li>
                <li><span>More breaks</span></li>
                <li><span>Somewhere to rest for short periods during the working day</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Any reasonable adjustments agreed should be reviewed on a regular basis to make sure they are working for both the 
                PwMS and the employer. Due to the progressive nature of MS, further reasonable adjustments may be needed over time.
            </p>

        <p>
            By law, PwMS are not obligated to disclose to their employer that they have MS unless there are health and safety risks (e.g., some medications 
            are required to be disclosed by law). The PwMS cannot access any adjustments unless their MS has been disclosed; therefore, early disclosure can 
            be vital if effective and optimal support is to be organised. When a PwMS does decide to disclose their MS, support from a colleague, occupational 
            therapist, MS nurse or a union representative at the meeting can be helpful. A Disability Employment Advisor can give more advice and support in 
            applying for a job and can also support PwMS who are in work but are experiencing difficulties.
        </p>
        <p>The occupational or vocational rehabilitation specialist can work with the PwMS to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Educate them about relevant legislation and how it applies to them, including the nature of “reasonable adjustments/accommodation”</span></li>
            <li><span>Support with disclosure, communicating needs and concerns to the employer, requesting accommodations if there are difficulties and using support systems such as co-workers when help is needed</span></li>
            <li><span>Offer counselling to support PwMS to adapt, adjust and resolve complex issues and manage the stress and demands of the job</span></li>
            <li><span>Manage symptoms that impact on work performance</span></li>
            <li><span>Encourage PwMS to organise workloads, set priorities and pace themselves</span></li>
            <li><span>Plan work, making changes to the work environment including job modification and technological support to minimise the physical demands</span></li>

        </ul>
