        <h2>1.4 Barriers to effective rehabilitation </h2>

        <p>
            There are various barriers that can determine the effectiveness of rehabilitation for PwMS: 
        </p>

        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        <br />

        <ul>
            <li><span>Severity of MS symptoms and associated impairments can determine level of participation in rehabilitative therapy</span></li>
            <li><span>Progressive worsening of symptoms, either physical or cognitive, can impair effective rehabilitation if deterioration leads to a decrease in functionality  </span></li>
            
        </ul>
        <h2>Inactivity</h2><br />
        <ul>
            <li><span>Periods of inactivity can determine the effectiveness of future rehabilitative interventions<sup>23</sup>. Inactivity can: increase deconditioning; 
                exacerbate common MS symptoms (e.g., fatigue, mobility impairments) and increase risk of developing secondary conditions, all of which can further 
                augment inactivity and participation restrictions<sup>24</sup> </span></li>
            
        </ul>
        <h2>Other barriers</h2><br />
        <ul><li><span>Availability, dissemination (including waiting times) and provision of information regarding rehabilitation services in the area<sup>25</sup>  </span></li>
            <li><span>Lack of follow-up and encouragement for PwMS to maintain the rehabilitation skills they have acquired</span></li>
            <li><span>Practical barriers such as family commitments and travel restrictions which would prevent PwMS from using a rehabilitation service<sup>25</sup></span></li>
            <li><span>Personal and statutory finances<sup>25</sup></span></li>
            <li><span>Referrals that are deemed unsuitable for rehabilitation due to their level of disability and the anticipated benefit vs. cost ratio</span></li>
        </ul>
        <br />

            <p>
                Start to collect pre-and post (qualitative and quantitative) rehabilitation programme data from the first consultation. This will demonstrate 
                effectiveness and impact. Anecdotal evidence is valuable too, and will show how rehabilitation can enhance QoL, and enable “living well” with 
                MS from the PwMS’s perspective. It is important to demonstrate that the PwMS is able to remain fully engaged with life as a result of rehabilitation. 
                Health fidelity to positive change can be demonstrated by follow up reviews over time.
