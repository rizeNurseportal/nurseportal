			2.9 Goal setting from a home-based perspective</h2>
        <p>The setting of rehabilitation interventions is dependent upon disease characteristics, personal finances, environmental factors and the availability of 
            rehabilitation services (see section 6 for more detailed information).</p>
        <p>Home-based rehabilitation can be used as a follow-up of the more intense rehabilitation performed at in-patient centres. Goal attainment can be oriented around 
            rehabilitation exercises performed in the home. A goal oriented around home-based activities should consist of achieving independence when performing everyday 
            living activities. </p>
        <p>The MDR team should help identify the issues that are currently preventing the PwMS from performing the activities outlined when forming their goals; the MDR 
            team can then prescribe rehabilitative interventions to aid in goal achievement. 
            </p>
        <p>An occupational therapist is especially important when planning goals for 
            home based rehabilitation as they can advise which types of assistive devices are suitable for achieving goals at home e.g., dressing sticks, adapted cutlery, 
            cups, toilet seats and frames (see section 5 for more detailed information). </p>

            <p>
               Sometimes achievement and overcoming challenges will occur within the minutiae of daily living and are often unnoticed by the PwMS and others. Encourage 
                the PwMS to keep a journal of things achieved in daily life; this can facilitate new insights into personal ability and capacity.
            </p>
             <p>We often do not know just how wonderful we are!</p>
