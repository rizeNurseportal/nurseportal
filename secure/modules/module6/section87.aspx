        <h2>8.7 Educating managers/employers and work colleagues</h2>

        <p>
            It is the employer’s responsibility to ensure the PwMS is treated fairly in the workplace and information shared about their MS is clearly 
            understood, remains confidential and is acted upon. MS is unique to each individual and the support they need is determined by mutual 
            exchange of clear information, understanding and knowledge. Many employers are committed to supporting staff with MS but lack the necessary 
            skills and knowledge. A work site visit with the PwMS, a rehabilitation specialist and the employer is most likely to result in practical 
            and emotional support. It is important that during such visits the PwMS is supported to drive the agenda, rather than the vocational 
            rehabilitation professional. The aim is to ensure that the employer gets an effective and efficient employee. Employers may also require 
            education, yet little or no work has been done exploring employers’ concerns about managing employees with MS<sup>280</sup>.

            <p><i>Employers can help employees in a number of ways: protect their health and wellbeing and make sure that the huge progress made in reducing 
                work-related illness and injury continues; wherever possible, help them remain in work when health conditions arise by providing support and 
                making reasonable adjustments; help those who have been absent to return to appropriate work that they can perform without risk; and to use 
                the workplace as an opportunity to help improve their employees’ health and wellbeing.</i></p>
        </div>
        <p>It is important for employers to understand their legal obligations towards PwMS. There are some tools available to help both the employer and PwMS. 
            An example is the <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup2">Access to Work</a> Scheme.</p>
        <div id="deepdivepopup2" class="deepdivepopup">
                <p>
                 Access to Work is a UK government funded service that offers financial support to help someone who is disabled or has a long-term health 
                    condition to stay in work. It can’t be used to pay for any equipment they would normally need to use to do their job, or for any reasonable 
                    adjustments, but instead can help fund adaptations to equipment, special equipment, fares to work, a support worker or job coach to help the 
                    PwMS in the workplace, or disability awareness training for colleagues.</p>
              </div>
        <p><i><a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup3">‘Working out MS in the Workplace: A Practical Toolkit for Employers’</a></i> by the European Multiple Sclerosis Platform (EMSP), was developed as part of the 
            European Employment Pact, a pledge to support PwMS in the workplace . This is part of the Paving the Path to Participation (PPP) project which aims to 
            stimulate policy change that will support maximum participation of PwMS in the European labour market.</p>

        <p><b>Case Study: Return to Work Process</b></p>
        <p>Return-to-work programmes are based upon a biopsychosocial approach combining medical, psychological and social aspects. To determine eligibility 
            and the potential for a return to work, the multidisciplinary team (MDT) should use assessment protocols which focus equally on a person's health 
            and personal factors, along with functional and environmental factors and barriers to a return to work and job retention. The return-to-work 
            process is person centred and individualised, with the aim of enabling the PwMS to regain the ability to participate in the workforce, and cope 
            with the implications of their illness within the workplace. The approach is always accompanied by a monitoring cycle, beginning with an initial 
            and ending with a final assessment to measure its effectiveness for the person concerned.</p>
        <p>In the return-to-work context, early intervention aims at reporting injuries and/or disabilities and changes to health conditions as they occur, 
            taking appropriate actions immediately to secure the right treatment and rehabilitation with the aim of returning the PwMS to work at the earliest 
            opportunity.</p>
        <p>The MDT should work with relevant internal and external parties within both the workplace and health setting to implement the early identification 
            and intervention practice. The MDT should collaborate with major stakeholders to develop a plan for meeting the needs of the PwMS, including 
            strategies to address potential barriers to their return to work. The plan should outline needs and objectives, strategies and interventions 
            such as requisite treatment, stakeholders' responsibilities, timelines and evaluation stages. The MS Nurse should document the plan and ensure 
            it is signed by the major stakeholders, including the PwMS, their employer and neurologist (if appropriate). In drawing up the plan, the MS Nurse 
            should take into account workplace factors that may impact upon accommodations for the PwMS. The MDT should monitor and evaluate progress on the 
            return to work and introduce appropriate interventions as necessary.</p>
        <p>Success in return-to-work programmes are directly related to the extent to which employees/PwMS are involved in and committed to the process. It is 
            necessary to actively promote and support an approach that encourages their engagement and ensures that they understand the value of return-to-work process, 
            are motivated to participate and have confidence in the other players in the return-to-work process.</p>
