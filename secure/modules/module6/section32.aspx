        <p>
           The contribution that rehabilitation makes to health-related quality- of- life (HRQoL) of PwMS can change across the disease trajectory. Rehabilitative 
            interventions should always focus on helping to maintain optimal levels of functional independence of PwMS, regardless of their MS course. 
        </p>

        <p>
           The focus and goals of rehabilitative interventions should be assessed and refined throughout the MS trajectory. The types of interventions required should be assessed 
            and refined at every change in course of the disease (i.e. after a relapse or progression to a different phenotype).
        </p>

            People with MS are faced with increasingly complex decisions, and
            need up-to-date, evidence-based information and decision-support systems in order to
            make informed decisions.
        </div>

        <p>
            The role of the educator demands a comprehensive understanding of the disease process and
            the effect of MS on personal health and life status. The education MS Nurses provide must be
            constant, yet dynamic and <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1">empower</a> 
            patients to understand their illness and optimise their quality of life<sup>15,17,18</sup>. 
            The more patients know about their MS, the more empowered
            they are to take control of their lives.

                Empowerment is essential for people with MS, families, and for healthcare
                providers in dealing with MS and its widespread implications<sup>19</sup>. Empowerment focuses on “what
                can be,” not on “what was”. Self-efficacy, self- confidence, skill development, and effective
                communication are vital components and key features to promote successful coping with this
                chronic neurological condition.

                How would you transfer the skills and knowledge to a person with
                MS so that they can ensure positive coping strategies, and effectively self-manage
                their MS?

                I try to schedule regular appointments with the person so that I am able to pass the information
                to them in small, manageable pieces. This also gives me the opportunity to repeat information
                as necessary and also allows the patient to ask questions as required. It is also important to
                pass your full contact details to the patient – this enables the person to be able to contact you
                by telephone or e-mail when any problems occur, without them having to wait until the next
                scheduled face-to-face appointment.

        <p>
           MS patients may have cognitive impairment, and educating people with MS can be a challenging experience for nurses. Even in the absence of cognitive impairment, patients frequently ask the same questions repeatedly or fail to apply information to given tasks or self-procedures. Supporting material that can be taken home and referred to as necessary is helpful together with family or caregiver involvement. Patients should not be deemed able to perform a particular procedure until they have done so together with the MS Nurse<sup>20</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>            
            It is very important for the MS Nurse to enable the individual to maintain active participation in managing their MS. The educated person will feel a sense of empowerment, acceptance, and well-being. The Nurse can assist in this process by referring people to a wide range of resources, including websites, leaflets and patient help groups.
        </p>
        <p>The use of the Web varies widely according to personal characteristics, health role (MS patient or family member), and time from the diagnosis. A recent Italian study found some MS patients found the Internet useful for collecting information and learning about others’ experiences (also using social networks), while others were cautious and preferred relying on information given by their neurologist. MS patients were mainly “on demand” users, searching on the Web before and/or after seeing the neurologist or when a new therapy or a new risk factor was proposed.<sup>21</sup></p>
        
        <div class="keypoint">
            It is very important for the MS Nurse to encourage the person to
            avoid a passive role and assume a proactive stance about their MS.
        </div>

        <p>
            It is important for the MS Nurse to support reasonable expectations of proposed treatments and
            side effects, to educate and guide on self-care and promote living well with MS.
        </p>

        <p>
            MS Nurses must assess the unique, individual information needs of each person to effectively
            provide the information required. This can be facilitated by:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span>Giving clear, realistic interpretations of the information</span></li>
            <li><span>Checking the patient’s understanding and expectations</span></li>
            <li><span>Supporting that understanding by referral to appropriate further information
                resources, providing literature to take away or contact details for additional help</span></li>
            <li><span>Providing a written and well understood management plan</span></li>
            <li><span>Ensuring there is appropriate follow-up booking/appointment in place</span></li>
            <li><span>Ensuring the patient has full contact details of their MS Nurse (e-mail address,
                mobile phone number) in order that the patient can reach that Nurse when support is
                needed</span></li>
            <li><span>Including the family or caregiver in all education</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
           Information provision for people with MS seems to increase disease-related knowledge, with less clear results on decision making and quality of life. There are no negative side effects from informing patients about their disease<sup>22</sup>. Effectively achieved education enables patients to be autonomous, self-determined and motivated in managing diagnosis, treatments and healthy living. The MS Nurse’s support, advice, education, and expertise will advance the person’s potential pre-conception of MS from that of an incurable and uncontrollable disease to one of it being a manageable problem that is a part of his or her life (figure 1).

            MS patients place inherent value on patient support programmes (PSPs). From a patient's viewpoint, PSPs provide real incremental benefit in patient-reported health status at all stages of MS<sup>23</sup>. Encouraging <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup2">self-management</a> 
            is consistent with recent moves in countries such as the UK where the ‘expert patient 
            programme’, aims that patients should give other patients the skills, knowledge and 
            confidence to participate actively in all aspects of their own health care<sup>1</sup>.

                The Chronic Disease Self-Management Course (CDSMC) is a lay-led self-management 
                intervention that provides participants with a range of skills and strategies, 
                which is currently being used in a number of countries (e.g. UK, US, Australia and Canada). 
                The course is not disease-specific and participants with any chronic disease can attend 
                together.
            </p>
            <p>
                The focus of the CDSMC is the promotion of an individual’s ability to select the 
                self-management tool that will meet their individual needs at that time. CDSMC has 
                been shown to be effective in randomised controlled trials among participants with arthritis, 
                lung disease, heart disease and stroke<sup>24</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A recent study aimed to assess the impact of the CDSMC on people with MS. It compared 
                two groups of randomised individuals attending a CDSMC with additional data collected 
                from a group of informed non-attendees<sup>24</sup>. Results showed that the CDSMC had a statistically 
                significant impact on self-management, self-efficacy and MSIS physical status, and showed a 
                trend towards improvement in depression and MS self-efficacy, with all improvements being 
                maintained over a 12-month period<sup>24</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall the study concluded that the CDSMC provides some small positive effects for people 
                with MS, and that the motivation to attend such a course may be related to the psychological 
                distress of the individual and their disease duration. In particular, the authors felt that 
                the CDSMC might be of value for those with mild anxiety/depression who need extra support, 
                and they recommend attendance early in the disease course<sup>24</sup>.
