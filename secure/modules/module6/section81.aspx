               MS is a condition of young people, with most diagnoses occurring in people in their 20s and 30s; the prime years for developing and 
                maintaining a working career<sup>247</sup>. Being out of work can have a devastating effect on health and unemployed people have much higher 
                levels of chronic conditions unrelated to their original diagnosis. They also have substantially higher rates of mental health disorders, 
                alcoholism and suicide. Rehabilitation for PwMS to remain in work is therefore high priority.

            <p>Vocational rehabilitation, defined as a “process whereby those disadvantaged by illness or disability can be enabled to access, maintain or 
                return to employment, or other useful occupation”<sup>248</sup>, provides a mechanism for PwMS to make adjustments in their careers and to remain at work. 
                This is achieved by multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes offered by local or specialist rehabilitation services enabling PwMS to: </p>
         <ul>
