            6.2 Home-based rehabilitation versus other settings</h2>

        <p>
            Over the past 20 years there has been a global trend toward healthcare delivery away from hospital and closer to home. This trend aims to increase 
            cost-effectiveness, access and sustainability<sup>197</sup>. 
        </p>
        <p>The outcomes of hospital or home-based rehabilitation are varied in terms of effectiveness, cost and psychological effects. A recently updated systematic 
            review of rehabilitation in MS supports the effectiveness of multidisciplinary programmes in both in-patient and ambulatory settings in terms of 
            improvements in activity (disability) and participation<sup>198</sup>.</p>
        <p>Out-patient rehabilitation is less expensive than the in-patient rehabilitation programme; however, out-patient rehabilitation can be more burdensome 
            for patients in terms of economic resources and commitment (travel cost, caregiver time management, etc).</p>
        <h3><i>6.2.1	Home setting</i></h3>
        <p>Home-based rehabilitation can be self-administered with periodic review by external facilitators. Evaluation of home-based programmes has suggested that 
            major advantages include convenience and the “real-life” nature of the setting<sup>199</sup> allowing components of the programme to be integrated into daily 
            activities from the outset. A concern with home-based programmes is the potential for risk of injury with unsupervised exercise. There is, however, 
            minimal evidence supporting this.</p>
        <p>Home-based rehabilitation can promote PwMS physical activity and improve functional capabilities and QoL outside of the hospital 
            environment<sup>200,201</sup>. Rehabilitation performed at home has been found to elicit significant improvements in 
            balance<sup>202</sup>, leg extensor power<sup>203</sup>, and gait parameters<sup>204</sup>. A supervised, home-based rehabilitation programme for PwMS with mild to moderate disability also 
            reported excellent retention along with high compliance rates with results evident for at least three months afterwards<sup>205</sup>. </p>
        <p>The types of home-based rehabilitation programmes that have been found to be effective are listed below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span><a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup2">Calisthenic exercises</a> are economical, do not require any devices and can lead to improvements in balance, gait, psychological status and QoL<sup>206</sup>. 
                PwMS must be trained how to perform such exercises by a physical therapist, specialised in the treatment of PwMS</span></li>
            <li><span>Web-based physiotherapy has access benefits and enables activity at any time, and in any location, as long as there is web connectivity. 
                Such services are generally used by PwMS who are computer literate and have mild form of MS<sup>207</sup> </span></li>
            <li><span>Other home-based programmes for patients with mild-moderate forms of MS include Wii fit balance exercises<sup>208</sup> and virtual reality balance and 
                postural control exercises<sup>209</sup>. Wearable IT equipment (e.g., FitBit) and smart phone apps are also good choices for home-based use </span></li>
        </ul>
         <div id="deepdivepopup2" class="deepdivepopup">
                <p>
                Calisthenics are exercises consisting of a variety of gross motor movements—running standing, grasping, pushing, etc.—often performed rhythmically 
                    and without equipment or apparatus. They are intended to increase body strength, body fitness, and flexibility, through movements such as bending, 
                    jumping, or swinging, using only body weight for resistance. When performed vigorously and with variety, calisthenics can provide the benefits of 
                    muscular and aerobic conditioning, in addition to improving psychomotor skills such as balance, agility and co-ordination.</p>
              </div>
        <p>Individually tailored home-based programmes may lead to improved perceptions of control, ownership, and self-efficacy. Such programmes also allow greater 
            choice over type, planning and progression of rehabilitation activities and facilitate the involvement of family members as sources of support, feedback, 
            and motivation<sup>210,211</sup>. All are important mediators of behavioural change and engagement.

</p>
        <p>Weekly home/out-patient physical therapy performed over 8 weeks has shown some effectiveness for improving balance, disability, and gait but is probably 
            ineffective for improving upper extremity dexterity<sup>212</sup>. </p>
        <h3><i>6.2.2	Out-patient setting</i></h3>
        <p>PwMS whose neurological disability has stabilised and who are mobile are ideal for out-patient rehabilitation. Initially, the PwMS might need to attend several times per week; 
            visits can then be reduced accordingly, depending on progress and distance from home.</p>
        <p>Community-based settings in venues that are not health-focused can be attractive to PwMS, as they are perceived as being more socially acceptable 
            and “normal,” and may be more convenient to access. In MS, studies have suggested that a range of non-hospital-based settings are seen as acceptable, 
            but that there appears to be a preference for settings where exercise can be undertaken away from the general population<sup>213</sup>. There is also increasing use 
            of local health gyms/sports centres with provision for specialised exercise classes. </p>
        <p>Participating in rehabilitation programmes away from home offer advantages of group interaction as a motivation to attend and engage in activities, 
            and to transition and commit to behavioural change<sup>214</sup>. Findings suggest shared experiences may encourage participants to challenge themselves<sup>215</sup>. 
            Regular access to “expert” support, guidance, and facilitation can be a positive influence on engagement and satisfaction with rehabilitation programmes<sup>216</sup>.</p>
       <p>Barriers to engagement with out-patient programmes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span><b>Logistic issues</b> (e.g., availability of transportation and accessibility factors), particularly with programmes requiring regular attendance 
                over a long period<sup>217</sup> </span></li>
            <li><span><b>Time and energy</b> required for regular attendance, representing an additional burden on PwMS already dealing with ongoing challenges<sup>218</sup>. 
                This may be particularly important in PwMS given the prevalence of fatigue as a significant symptom<sup>219</sup>.</span></li>
             </ul>
              
         <div class="keypoint">
          There are often things I can sometimes do at home but can't do it on demand for a therapist - for example if I've had to travel to a therapy centre 
             for neurophysiotherapy I'm often so exhausted by the time I get there I can't show them what I can do. So, it is important that they listen to 
             me and understand and also believe what I can do at home.
        </div>

        <h3><i>6.2.3	Hospital setting</i></h3>

        <p>In-patient multidisciplinary rehabilitation is generally focused on PwMS with complex needs that require intensive multimodal treatment and 
            additional nursing support<sup>220,221</sup>. This acute rehabilitation setting is appropriate for PwMS who meet the admission criteria and are able to 
            tolerate 3 hours or more of active therapy per day. For people managing long-term conditions, engagement in ongoing hospital-based 
            rehabilitation programmes may be incompatible with an increasing emphasis on facilitating self-management, and the aim of providing 
            person-centred care<sup>201</sup>.</p>

        <p>
          Research suggests in-patient programmes are perceived as “safe” and the staff “knowledgeable” by participants<sup>222</sup>; with availability of support 
            and backup giving confidence to programme facilitators<sup>223</sup>. The in-patient setting was associated with a significant improvement in:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Functional impairment<sup>224</sup></span></li>
            <li><span>Disability<sup>206,225</sup></span></li>
            <li><span>Functional independence<sup>226</sup></span></li>
            <li><span>HRQoL<sup>205,209</sup>. </span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>A recent study found a 4-week period of in-patient multidisciplinary rehabilitation was associated with improvements in QoL<sup>227</sup>. 
            These positive benefits were seen immediately at discharge and "most importantly" remained at the 6-month follow-up.</p>
        <p>The drawbacks of in-patient treatment are higher costs, and the unaccustomed daily life and environment, which can result in positive achievements not being carried through to the home environment.</p>
