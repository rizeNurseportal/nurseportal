        <h2>6.3 Telerehabilitation</h2>

        <p>
            Travel distance to rehabilitation clinics, neurological disability and associated costs can often limit access to specialised rehabilitation services. 
            To address these issues, web-based systems and smart phone apps have been developed to support home-based self-directed exercise programmes. 
            Telerehabilitation, a service delivery model using telecommunications technology (e.g., the internet) to provide therapy at a distance, can 
            significantly improve functional outcomes in PwMS<sup>207,228</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants are generally taught exercises during a consultation session at a hospital. A rehabilitation programme in the form of exercise drawings, 
            written descriptions, and videos of the therapist performing the exercises is then downloaded on a home computer. The programmes can be updated or 
            revised as necessary. </p>
        <p>A qualitative analysis of a variety of interventions in PwMS (including physical activity, educational, behavioural and symptom management programmes) 
            found low level evidence for the effectiveness of telerehabilitation on reducing short-term disability and reducing and/or improving symptoms, such as 
            fatigue<sup>229</sup>. There was low level evidence suggesting some benefit of telerehabilitation in improving functional activities; improving symptoms in the 
            longer-term; and psychological outcomes and QoL. </p>
        <p>A Cochrane review also found limited evidence on the efficacy of telerehabilitation in improving functional activities, fatigue and QoL in PwMS<sup>230</sup>. It also 
            found insufficient evidence to support what types of interventions are effective. A recent study found that engagement and 
            participation in routine home-based exercise was challenging<sup>231</sup>. A pilot study presented at ECTRIMS found telerehabilitation to be of comparable efficacy 
            to conventional in-person physical therapy as measured by objective outcomes of gait and balance<sup>232</sup>.</p>
        <p>There are limited data on safety, process evaluation and no data on cost-effectiveness of telerehabilitation. This indicates that more robust trials 
            are needed to build evidence about these interventions. Additional research is required to determine the cost-effectiveness of this method as well as 
            the impact it has on QoL.</p>
