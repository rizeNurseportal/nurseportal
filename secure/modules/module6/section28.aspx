        <h2>2.8	Contribution of the multidisciplinary rehabilitation team to goal setting process</h2>

        <p>
            A team approach to rehabilitation has many benefits, and current clinical practice guidelines, supported by the Cochrane MS Group, recommend the 
            multidisciplinary model of care for PwMS<sup>48</sup>. MDR can be described as in-patient, out-patient, home or community based programmes, delivered by two or 
            more disciplines in conjunction with physician consultation.
        </p>
        <p>
            A neurologist, experienced in rehabilitation, may often lead the MDR team but this will vary from centre to centre. Other medical doctors should be available 
            for consultancies including urologists (experienced in neuro-urological problems), ophthalmologists and physiatrists. Nurses, occupational and speech and 
            language therapists, art therapists and physiotherapists are a few of the specialists that can be part of the MDR team – this list is not exhaustive.
        </p>
        <p>The MDR team should follow a <b>systematic approach</b> to address PwMS’ issues<sup>49</sup> and identify goals. This step-by-step approach is outlined below. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Evaluation and problem identification - each team member provides input according to their expertise</span></li>
            <li><span>Set goals associated with identified issues and/or needs of PwMS</span></li>
            <li><span>Prescription of specific rehabilitative interventions to increase different characteristics of functional capacity. Interventions can be prescribed 
               to contribute to the following aspects of rehabilitative care:</span>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>General conditioning</span></li>
                    <li><span>Improving physical impairments (fine motor skills, strength, balance, walking distance, walking speed, communication, swallowing)</span></li>
                    <li><span>Training to compensate for deficits (bladder and bowel training programmes, cognitive retraining)</span></li>
                    <li><span>Incorporating medications as needed</span></li>
                    <li><span>Incorporating adaptive equipment</span></li>
                    <li><span>Learning new skills (e.g., vocational re-training)</span></li>
                    <li><span>Psychosocial adaptation</span></li>
                    <li><span>Continually practicing the rehabilitation treatment regimes</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><span>Follow through of prescribed treatments: </span>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Check adherence to the initiated programme </span></li>
                    <li><span>Reassess and monitor progress and progression of prescribed rehabilitative interventions</span></li>
                    <li><span>Confirm the continuous availability of the MDR team as well as confirming open communication among team members</span></li>
                    <li><span>Assess interaction with community resources (MS organisations, visiting MS nurses)</span></li>
                    <li><span>Perform re-evaluation by the MDR team in 3–12 months</span></li>
                    <li><span>Support PwMS with reasonable long-term planning</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
