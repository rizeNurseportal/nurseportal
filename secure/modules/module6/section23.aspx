        <h2>2.3	Importance of goal setting during rehabilitation</h2>

        <p>
           A goal can be defined as ‘how things will be at some setting defined in the future and that it is a desired state that requires both action and effort’<sup>31</sup> . 
            It is crucial that goal setting involves both the PwMS and MDR team. Together, both parties can identify key priorities for defined activities, as well 
            as agree upon performance levels to be realised within a specific time frame<sup>32</sup>. By setting goals:  
        </p>
        <ul>
				<li><span>The direction of treatment is set</span></li>
				<li><span>Meetings will remain focused on the needs and objectives of the PwMS</span></li>
                <li><span>Markers for progress are established for reporting to PwMS, family, referral sources and funders<sup>28</sup></span></li>

             </ul>
        <p>Once goals have been identified and set, appropriate rehabilitative therapy can then be agreed upon. Key decisions include: </p>
         <ul>
				<li><span>The duration of the intervention (i.e. number of sessions) </span></li>
				<li><span>Selecting a date at which a goal realisation is reviewedS</span></li>
                <li><span>Location of therapy (i.e. hospital, community, home)></span></li>
                <li><span>Frequency of sessions </span></li>
                <li><span>Methods used during therapy sessions (e.g., patient education, physical exercise, cognitive training exercises, coaching on adaptive devices) )</span></li>
                <li><span>The intensity of sessions (i.e. duration and planned level of activity/exertion) </span></li>
                <li><span>Who will be present at each session (PwMS, family member(s)) </span></li>	
			</ul>
        <p>The goals for MS rehabilitation can be classed as restorative or preventive<sup>33</sup>. The MDR team should help the PwMS to differentiate between these goal types and 
            plan rehabilitative therapy accordingly. </p>

            <p>
                Discuss what the most important roles in life are for the PwMS. We measure our value, sense of worth and esteem via our roles and identifying what really matters will help to identify the context and the type of rehabilitation needed. Understand what really matters to that person, their family and friends and work with them on setting and achieving goals. It will also identify the barriers. Be flexible over time.
