        <h2>5.4 Speech and communication</h2>
    <h3><i>5.4.1 Background</i></h3>
        <p>
            PwMS can experience a range of communication problems which can occur at any stage of the disease<sup>175</sup>. These can lead to social isolation, 
            depression and loss of independence and may impact employment and social life<sup>176,177</sup>. Typical symptoms include:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li><span>Slurring of speech</span></li>
            <li><span>Problems with volume, strength or quality of voice</span></li>
            <li><span>Rapid speech that is difficult to understand</span></li>
            <li><span>Slow speech</span></li>
             <li><span>Nasal, raspy or strained voice</span></li>
           
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to dysarthria, communication problems can be due to cognitive changes such as slowed information-processing speed and dysfunctions in attention, 
            memory and executive functions<sup>178,179</sup>. Such cognitive dysfunctions can lead to difficulty finding the right word (often known as 'tip-of the 
            tongue state') and problems forming or completing sentences<sup>180</sup>. The presence of a cognitive-linguistic impairment can also reduce the capability 
            to benefit from rehabilitation<sup>181</sup>. </p>
        <h3><i>5.4.2 Assessment</i></h3>
        <p>A Speech and Language Therapist (SLT) can outline rehabilitation for communication problems. General assessment will involve an oromotor examination 
            and a description of breath support and phonation as well as observation and/or recording of the patient’s intelligibility in conservation<sup>182</sup>. 
            Specialised assessment will generally involve one or more of the following tests:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span><a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1">Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment (FDA)</a><sup>183</sup>    </span></li>
            <li><span>Dysarthia Profile<sup>184</sup></span></li>
            <li><span>Therapy Outcome Measures<sup>185</sup></span></li>
            <li><span>Voice Handicap Index<sup>186</sup></span></li>
                     
        </ul>
         <div id="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdivepopup">
                <p>
                   The FDA is quick and simple to administer.
                </p>
             <p>The patient is rated on a number of simple performance tasks related to speech function. It is divided into eight sections:</p>
             <ol>
            <li><span>Reflexes - ratings for cough, swallow, and dribble/drool</span></li>
            <li><span>Respiration - ratings at rest and in speech</span></li>
            <li><span>Lips - ratings for at rest, spread, seal, alternate, and in speech</span></li>
            <li><span>Palate - ratings for fluids, maintenance, and in speech</span></li>
             <li><span>Laryngeal - ratings for time, pitch, volume, and in speech</span></li>
                  <li><span>Tongue - ratings for at rest, protrusion, elevation, lateral, alternate, and in speech</span></li>
            <li><span>Intelligibility - ratings for words, sentences, and conversation</span></li>
             <li><span>Influencing Factors - includes hearing, sight, teeth, language, mood, posture, rate (words per minute), and sensation</span></li>
          
        </ol>

        <h3><i>5.4.3 Rehabilitation</i></h3>
        <p>The main goals of speech and language therapy are to increase intelligibility and functional communication – according to the stage of dysarthria 
            experienced by a PwMS<sup>187</sup>. Preventative interventions should start early to prevent the development of further communication problems, and to maintain 
            communicative participation<sup>188,189</sup>. More general interventions may include awareness of body posture, reduction of background noise, frontward 
            facing whilst communicating<sup>190</sup>. </p>
        <p> SLTs may utilise the Lee Silverman Voice Treatment – an intensive respiratory-phonatory treatment programme which acts to improve loudness and some 
        articulatory features<sup>191</sup>. Other therapies include expiratory muscle strength training<sup>192</sup> and music therapy<sup>193</sup>. Additional therapies are available for specifically 
        improving speech rate, prosody and articulation<sup>194,195,196</sup>.</p>
