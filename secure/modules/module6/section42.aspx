        <h2>4.2 Rehabilitation for common physical dysfunctions
        </h2>
        <h2><i>4.2.1 Mobility dysfunctions</i></h2>
        <h3><i>Background</i></h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                The Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) defines mobility as ‘the ability to move purposefully in one’s own environment independently with or without 
                an assistive device”<sup>87</sup>. 50% of PwMS will require some form of walking aid within 15 years of their diagnosis<sup>88</sup>. Considering this, and the wide range of 
                MS symptoms (e.g. weakness, spasticity, fatigue, balance dysfunction) that can contribute to restrictions in mobility, rehabilitation should be 
                encouraged soon after diagnosis, and conducted via a multidisciplinary approach. 
            </p>
            <h3><i>Rehabilitation</i></h3>
            <p>
                Rehabilitative therapy for impaired mobility must follow the basic principles:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Utilise tasks that are relevant/meaningful to the PwMS in their everyday life  </span></li>
                <li><span>Tasks should be paced, practiced and repeated </span></li>
                <li><span>Balance tasks to challenge, yet also enable the acquisition of new skills</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Possible courses of rehabilitation to maintain mobility could include: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Exercise training</span></li>
                <li><span>Physiotherapy</span></li>
                <li><span>Supplementation with compensatory aids (e.g., canes, orthotics and powered wheelchairs) </span></li>
                <li><span>Pharmacological therapy</span></li>
                <li><span>Complementary therapies including pilates, yoga, tai chi and reflexology<sup>89</sup></span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Walking has been reported as the most important function a PwMS wishes to maintain<sup>90</sup>, despite more recent emphasis being placed on hand 
                functionality<sup>91</sup>. 
                Numerous outcome measures are used to determine walking ability. Several positively correlate with the EDSS; due to this they will better represent a 
                PwMS’ walking ability<sup>92</sup>.They include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>The 12 Item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12)</span></li>
                <li><span>The Timed 25 Foot Walking Test (T25FW)</span></li>
                <li><span>The Time Up and Go test (TUG)</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It is important that a strategy for mobility rehabilitation is developed in the context of the requirements of daily living. Walking interventions 
                should be designed according to home needs e.g., cycle ergometry to improve stair climbing ability, benefits from rehabilitation acquired in an 
                in-patient or gym-based setting need to be transferable to a PwMS’ home. Furthermore, outcome measures like the MSWS-12 will inform how PwMS 
                perceive the degree of limitation of their walking ability. This can then be interpreted in several contexts such as requirements for indoor vs. 
                outdoor mobility<sup>93</sup>.

                <p>
                    <i>Discuss with PwMS what distance really matters most; for example, is walking around the office more important than walking to the station to get 
                to work? Is being able to watch football, or walk the dog more meaningful than walking round the supermarket? Enabling fresh insights will support 
                self-determination and motivation.</i>
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3><i>Role of exercise</i></h3>
            <p>
                Good exercise programmes not only prevent problems, they promote a sense of achievement and well-being. Exercise training has been proposed to 
                counteract many symptoms of MS such as fatigue and muscular weakness<sup>94,95</sup>. A combination of endurance and resistance training is likely to be 
                most effective<sup>96</sup>. There is evidence that both aerobic and/or resistance training can improve walking speed and endurance in PwMS<sup>97</sup>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Aerobic training 
                </span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Goal – to improve overall physical capacity</span></li>
                        <li><span>Programmes utilise: step, leg, and arm or cycling ergometers, treadmill walking, aquatic exercises</span></li>
                        <li><span>Effective for improving aerobic capacity and power output </span></li>
                        <li><span>Generally performed 2-3 times/week</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span>Resistance training</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Goal – to increase muscular strength, balance </span></li>
                        <li><span>Programmes utilise: weight machines, free weights, resistance bands, cycling, and aquatic training</span></li>
                        <li><span>Effective for improving muscular strength in PwMS</span></li>
                        <li><span>Generally performed 1-2 times/week </span></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><i>Role of physiotherapy </i></h3>
            <p>
                Physiotherapy has wide applications for different MS symptoms. For example, spasticity rehabilitation may consist of stretching exercises together with relaxation 
                and posture positioning techniques. The MDR team should emphasise the importance of maintaining flexibility. Proposing stretching exercises 
                which extend muscles and tendons to their full length<sup>98</sup>, whilst also moving joints through their full range is recommended. This can decrease muscle tightness and 
                prevent losses in full range of motion; this may occur due to decreased activity, weakness, or spasticity. Left unaddressed, such loss in motion can 
                lead to joint contractures that painfully “freeze” joints into a single position<sup>99</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <%--Physiotherapy based on the <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1">Bobath technique</a> has proved effective in improving balance and gait 
                in PwMS<sup>100</sup>. --%>
                Interventions focusing on locomotion 
                training using body weight support on a treadmill can also positively influence muscle strength, spasticity and balance<sup>101</sup>.
            </p>

            <div id="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdivepopup">
                <p>
                    The Bobath technique trains on moving in the most efficient manner possible. The basis of the Bobath concept lies in handling patients so that 
                the physiotherapist helps to facilitate movement by lengthening short muscles, mobilising or moving tight joints, strengthening weak muscles and 
                helping to keep their bodies in better alignment. This can be summarised as ‘stabilising wobbly bits and mobilising stiff bits’.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3><i>Role of mobility aids</i></h3>
            <p>
                Mobility aids may compensate for weakness, alleviate pain, improve posture, correct abnormal gait patterns and enable people to walk further and more 
                safely. Aids that may compensate reductions in mobility include:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><span>Ankle-foot orthoses – compensate for leg weakness </span></li>
                <li><span>Functional electrical simulation (FES) devices – improve walking distance</span></li>
                <li><span>Canes – provide support when balance and/or leg weakness is problematic</span></li>
                <li><span>Crutches – provide support when weakness is more severe and canes are not sufficient</span></li>
                <li><span>Rollators – offer stability when the lower body becomes weak or impaired</span></li>
                <li><span>Wheelchairs – provide mobility when walking, even with an aid is fatiguing or impossible</span></li>
                <li><span>Grab bars, bed rails, vehicle hand controls – provide necessary assistance to improve safety and efficiency
                </span></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4.2.2 Upper limb functioning</h2>
            <h3>Background </h3>
            <p>
                Upper limb (UL) functioning is important for functions requiring high levels of motor coordination, dexterity, and a precise collaboration between 
                both hands. About 75% of PwMS will experience problems with manual dexterity throughout their disease trajectory<sup>102</sup>. Although walking has 
                traditionally been viewed as the most important ability PwMS wish to maintain their independence in, a recent survey has identified that PwMS now 
                overwhelmingly consider maintenance of UL function of more concern to them<sup>91</sup>. These data complement an outcome from the recent ASCEND<sup>103</sup> trial of 
                natalizumab, where results indicated that worsening of UL function may be modifiable, even for those experiencing advanced MS courses. This further 
                emphasises the importance of continuous arm and hand rehabilitation.
            </p>
            <h3>Assessment</h3>
            <p>
                There are various measures that can be used to assess UL function during MS rehabilitation; multiple outcome measures are necessary to encapsulate the 
                multidimensional character of the upper limb function<sup>104</sup>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span><a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup2">Nine-hole peg test</a> (9-HPT)<sup>105</sup>  </span></li>
                <li><span>Hand grip strength<sup>106</sup> </span></li>
                <li><span>Arm Motor Ability Test<sup>107</sup> </span></li>
                <li><span>TEMPA test<sup>108</sup>   </span></li>
            </ul>
            <div id="deepdivepopup2" class="deepdivepopup">
                <p>
                    The 9-HPT has been one of the most frequently used measures of upper extremity function in MS. The 9-HPT provides a brief, 
                    standardised approach to assessment and can be administered by a wide variety of trained examiners.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h3>Rehabilitation </h3>
            <p>Typical rehabilitative interventions for UL function in PwMS can be designed from a training and compensatory perspective.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Training</b> approaches aim to maximise arm function by emphasising practising motor functions and coordination, as well as focusing 
                on performance in task-oriented functional activities. Some upper limb rehabilitative interventions include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span><a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup3">Constraint-induced movement therapy</a> (CIMT) incorporating repetitive task 
                            practice can lead to increases in functionally in a variety of tasks relevant to ADL (e.g., stacking cups, sorting towels)<sup>109</sup>.</span></li>
                <li><span>Computerised robotic and (electro) mechanical devices (i.e. arm ergometers); provide autonomous, repetitive, high-intensity

                <li><span>Home based motor training programmes have also been shown 
                            to improve arm and hand performance in MS<sup>111</sup>. </span></li>

            </ul>
            <div id="deepdivepopup3" class="deepdivepopup">
                <p>
                   CIMT consists of a set of rehabilitation techniques designed to reduce functional problems in the most affected UL. It involves constraining movements 
                    of the less-affected arm, usually with a sling or mitt for 90% of waking hours, while intensively inducing the use of the more-affected arm.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>Compensatory approaches to account for reductions in arm function may comprise of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Coaching in correct positioning of affected arm(s) </span></li>
                <li><span>Mobilisation of the arm and hand to prevent (further) development of contractures </span></li>
                <li><span>Coaching compensatory devices to account for upper limb dysfunctions (e.g., adaptive tools for eating, drinking, grooming)</span></li>

                    <i>Encourage activities such as abstract finger painting, air guitar playing to rock music or weaving to align with rehabilitation exercises. 
                        This will bring the “fun” element that reduces treatment burden and workload.</i>

            <h2><i>4.2.3 Ataxia and tremor</i></h2>
            <h3><i>Background</i></h3>

            <p>
                For some PwMS, coordination (ataxia) can be a relatively mild problem whilst for others it can be one of their most disabling symptoms. PwMS report 
                similar experiences with tremor. This is commonly experienced in the hand or arm, but can also affect the head, lips, jaw, tongue or eyes; as a result, 
                speaking ability or eye coordination can be affected. There are two types of tremor that are common in MS:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><span><b>Lntention tremor</b> manifests when a PwMS tries to reach for an object – it is the most common form of tremor experienced </span></li>
                <li><span><b>Postural tremor</b> is the shaking experienced by PwMS when they are sitting or standing </span></li>

            </ul>
            <h3><i>Rehabilitation</i></h3>
            <p>
                Both ataxia and tremor are difficult to treat; medication has a limited effect<sup>112</sup>. Rehabilitation focusing on adaptive interventions 
                is therefore a key element to coping with tremor:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><span>Weight training via specific weight placement on the trunk has positive effects on functional ambulation<sup>113</sup> </span></li>
                <li><span>Cooling strategies focusing on cooling affected limbs can temporarily reduce tremor amplituden<sup>114,115</sup></span></li>
                <li><span>Complementary cutlery reduces the need for fine precisionn<sup>116</sup> </span></li>

            </ul>
            <p>Physiotherapy-oriented rehabilitation that centres on reducing tremor in PwMS focuses on three forms of interventions (figure 5)<sup>117</sup>.</p>

            <div class="centeredimage">
                <div class="imagegroup">

            </div>
            <p>
                If tremor is present in the lips, tongue or jaw it can affect speech. Rehabilitation with a speech therapist focusing on lip, tongue and jaw movements, 
                    as well as speaking speed can aid with speech associated ataxia.
            </p>

            <h2><i>4.2.4 Muscle weakness</i></h2>
            <h3><i>Background</i></h3>
            <p>
                Muscle weakness has been described as one of the most feared symptoms of MS as it implies paralysis, loss of walking ability, and severe disability<sup>118</sup>. 
                Lack of activity will cause affected and non-affected muscles to become weak due to misuse.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the past, PwMS have been advised to avoid exercise as it was believed to worsen MS associated weakness and fatigue. Modern evidence now suggests that exercise which 
                gently builds up endurance and strength is good for reducing weakness and fatigue; it does not inhibit the progression of the disease<sup>119</sup>. 

            </p>
            <h3><i>Rehabilitation</i></h3>
            <p>
                Rehabilitation for muscle weakness will generally comprise of individualised, structured exercise programmes that are endurance and/or resistance 
                training based and which act to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Maintain muscle tone for muscles not receiving adequate nerve conduction 
                </span></li>
                <li><span>Strengthen surrounding muscles that are receiving nerve conduction
                </span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <b>Endurance training</b> is generally well tolerated among PwMS experiencing a mild-moderate impairment. There are benefits of endurance focused rehabilitative 
                interventions using, bicycle ergometry<sup>120</sup>; treadmill walking<sup>121</sup>; and aquatic exercise<sup>122</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Resistance training</b> is well tolerated in PwMS; it can positively affect fatigue, mood and QoL<sup>123</sup>. It is important that the MDR team designs 
                a programme appropriate for the current strength of the affected muscle.
            </p>
            <p>
                Exercise therapy performed early in the MS trajectory can increase aerobic capacity and reduce levels of weakness, but exercise programmes can be adapted to suit different 
                levels of disability at any disease stage; modifications are regularly needed to ensure a variable and appropriate training stimulus.
            </p>
            <p>
                Assistive mobility devices (see section 2) can also be helpful in addressing mobility issues associated with weakness. Using canes, rollators and wheelchairs can 
                improve safety and fatigue.

            <p>
                Bladder dysfunctions occur in over three-quarters of PwMS but only one third will actively seek help<sup>124</sup>. Different bladder dysfunctions are 
                associated with different courses of the MS trajectory.

            <p>A hyperactive bladder is the most common bladder dysfunction experienced by PwMS. </p>
            <p><b>See module 4 section 4.6 for more information on management of bladder dysfunctions.</b></p>
            <h3><i>Rehabilitation</i></h3>
            <p>Many PwMS develop hyperactivity of the detrusor muscle which causes bladder irritation and frequent voiding of small amounts of urine. If feasible, 
                post-void residual (PVR) urine levels can be monitored. The goal is to have <100 ml PVR, and a continent patient. Reducing fluid intake to <2000 ml/day 
                can help in achieving this. </p>
            <p>Hyperactive bladder rehabilitation can consist of the below rehabilitative interventions.</p>
             <ul>
                <li><span><b>Pelvic floor muscle training</b> (PFMT) – these are exercises (applicable for both sexes) that strengthen the pelvic floor.</span></li>
                <li><span><b>Intravaginal neuromuscular electrical stimulation</b> (NMES) – sends electric pulses or signals to precise areas of the weakened muscles in the pelvic area, causing them to contract and relax. These transmitted via electrode pads placed on the surface of the skin or by using an electrode probe vaginally or anally. </span></li>
                <li><span><b>Transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation</b> (TTNS) – is designed to indirectly stimulate the nerves that are responsible for bladder control. Small electrodes are placed on the skin by the ankle. Electrical signals travel along nerves and aid in retraining bladder function. </span></li>
                
            </ul>
            <p>Evidence from a 2016 study on women with MS suggested PFMT alone or in combination with intravaginal NMES or TTNS is effective in the treatment of 
                overactive bladder. Decreases in urgency, incontinence, hesitancy, incomplete bladder emptying and nocturia were all recorded<sup>126</sup>. </p>

            <h2><i>4.2.6 Bowel dysfunction</i></h2>
            <h3><i>Background </i></h3>
            <p>Bowel dysfunction occurs in over three-quarters of PwMS and is usually associated with bladder dysfunction<sup>127,128</sup>. As with bladder dysfunctions, 
                bowel dysfunctions in PwMS can contribute to social retirement, depression, reductions of sexual activity, increased spasticity, skin infections 
                and abdominal pain. Common symptoms include:</p>
             <ul>
                <li><span>Delayed gastric emptying</span></li>
                <li><span>Constipation</span></li>
                <li><span>Faecal incontinence </span></li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Rehabilitation </h3>
            <p>The MS nurse is often the lead member of the MDR team when developing bowel management interventions<sup>129</sup>: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Establishing a regular bowel voiding pattern is an early step; attempting to defecate 20-30 minutes after ingesting a meal is recommended<sup>130</sup> </span></li>
                <li><span>Managing fluid intake (2 L/day) and encouraging regular exercise</span></li>
                <li><span>Ensure adequate daily dietary fibre intake (15 g/day) results in softer and bulkier stools – improves transit time, constipation and incontinence<sup>131</sup> </span></li>
                <li><span>Abdominal massage increases the frequency of defecation </span></li>
                <li><span>Bulk forming, softening and stimulating drug agents can be utilised to aid bowel dysfunction</span></li>
                <li><span>Rectal suppositories and laxatives may also be used </span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>For neurogenic bowel dysfunctions, an individualised but multidisciplinary rehabilitative approach using a combination of physiotherapeutic 
                and possibly drug interventions is advisable. </p>

            <h2><i>4.2.7 Swallowing dysfunctions</i></h2>
            <h3><i>Background</i></h3>
            <p>
                <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup4">Swallowing problems (dysphagia)</a> frequently occur throughout the trajectory of MS, affecting 
                over one-third of PwMS<sup>132</sup>. Dysphagia is more 
                typically a feature of advanced, progressive MS but it can occur in PwMS with non-progressive courses. As MS Nurses are often the first point of 
                contact in rehabilitation centres for a PwMS, they should be adept at recognising the symptoms of dysphagia. The primary swallowing symptoms of 
                dysphagia can occur singly or in combination in PwMS<sup>133</sup> and include:  
            </p>

                <p>
                  <b>Dysphagia</b> is a disturbance of the complex sensorimotor functions of swallowing. Neurogenic dysphagia (ND) is dysphagia resulting from a neurological 
                    disease. In ND, disturbances of the oral and/or pharyngeal phase are very frequent, in contrast to rarely-occurring oesophageal 
                    problems (‘oropharyngeal dysphagia’).

            </ul>
            <h2><i>Rehabilitation</i></h2>
            <p>
                Goals for dysphagia rehabilitation should be aimed at preserving or returning PwMS to a normal diet, improving their nutritional status and 
                reducing opportunity for developing aspiration pneumonia<sup>134,135,136</sup>. Some common rehabilitative interventions are described below.
            </p>
            <h3><i>Restorative interventions</i></h3><br />
            <ul>
                <li><span>Stimulation of face, mouth and tongue (e.g., stretching, pressure, brushing, thermal stimuli)</span></li>
                <li><span>Functional exercises of tongue and lips, speech breathing and vocal exercises, Masako manoeuvre (i.e. tongue holding)</span></li>
                <li><span>Thermal stimulation for triggering the swallow reflex</span></li>
            </ul>
            <h3><i>Compensatory interventions</i></h3><br />
            <ul>
                <li><span>Manoeuvring posture to modify pharynx shape and redirect bolus material – preventing aspiration</span></li>
                <li><span>Training of specialised swallowing techniques (e.g., ‘double swallow’)</span></li>
                <li><span>Delivering food via better half of tongue (if applicable)</span></li>
                <li><span>Adapting diet to include more mashed foods and thickened beverages</span></li>
                <li><span>Use of compensatory eating and drinking devices</span></li>
                <li><span>Ensuring upright positioning of body and head </span></li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                Dysphagia affects QoL, especially in terms of activity limitation and participation restriction. Outcome measures used to evaluate dysphagia 
                rehabilitation should therefore be based upon clinically relevant rather than surrogate end-points e.g., SWAL-QOL<sup>137</sup> .
