        <h2>1.2 Why rehabilitation?</h2>
        <div class="icon_intro">
            <p>
                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease with physical,psychological and psychological consequences which can impact nearly every aspect of a person(s) with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) life . Rehabilitation is a key component that needs to be factored into the care of a PwMS for a number of important reasons.

            <p><span>Rehabilitation aims to:</span></p>

            <ul>
               
                <li><span>Reduce disability by problem solving and educational interventions<sup>2</sup> </span></li>
                <li><span>Optimise overall functional capacity by goal attainment<sup>3</sup>  </span></li>
                <li><span>Improve ability to perform basic daily functions</span></li>
                <li><span>Facilitate social integration, communication and overall mobility<sup>1</sup>  </span></li>
                <li><span>Minimise secondary complications (e.g., contractures)<sup>1</sup></span></li>
            </ul>
            <h2><i>Improvement in emotional well-being and quality-of-life</i></h2>
            <p><span>Rehabilitation aims to:</span></p>

            <ul>
                <li><span>Improve emotional well-being and quality- of- life (QoL)<sup>1,4</sup></span></li>
                <li><span>Empower a PwMS so they are more confident in their functional abilities</span></li>
                <li><span>Restore lost skills and regain maximum self-sufficiency<sup>4,5,6</sup>  </span></li>
                <li><span>Facilitate self-determination and confidence</span></li>
                <li><span>Improve short- and long-term health outcomes<sup>7,8,9</sup>  </span></li>
                <li><span>Benefit the individual, their family and society, improving a wide range of outcomes)</span></li>
                <li><span>Minimise dependency on others</span></li>
            </ul>
            <h2><i>Lower healthcare costs</i></h2><br />
            <ul>
                <li><span> Rehabilitation can lower healthcare costs by shorting hospital stays as a result of improving the overall health of a PwMS<sup>7-9</sup></span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>In contrast, <b>unmet rehabilitation needs</b> can have negative effects on QoL and can lead to:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Delays in hospital discharges<sup>10,11,12,13,14,15</sup></span></li>
                <li><span>Limits on the number and type of activities a PwMS can participate in<sup>16,17,18,19,20,21</sup></span></li>
                <li><span>Deteriorations in overall health<sup>12-15</sup></span></li>
                <li><span>Increasing dependency on carers for assistance and an overall decrease in QoL<sup>12-15</sup></span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>These negative outcomes have broad social and financial implications for PwMS, their families and their communities<sup>17-21</sup></p>

            <p>
                Ask the PwMS and their family what their understanding and expectations of a rehabilitation programme might be. This should be done in the same way 
                as you would assess for understanding and expectations of any MS treatments. Have an honest, non-judgemental conversation that allows for unrealistic 
                expectations or misinformation to be addressed from the outset. Sharing and agreeing together what might be achievable will enable self-determination 
                throughout the rehabilitation journey. Remember too, that it should be fun, and not add too much workload to the treatment burden.
