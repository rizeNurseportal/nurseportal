			2.6 Setting SMART goals  </h2>

		<div>
			<p>
				The success of setting goals depends on how the goals are formulated<sup>28</sup>. It is important that a PwMS is aware that the goals they set (with/without their 
                families/carers input) are achievable. Unrealistic goals may lead to the perception that “rehabilitation doesn’t work” and can increase patient frustration. 
                Some PwMS might need more challenging goals than others; this should be considered on an individual basis.
			</p>
            <div class="keypoint">
			It was important to me to have some goals where I didn't know how much I could achieve or whether I could achieve anything at all…but it was important to 
                me to give it a go and just see what happened rather than limit myself to achievable targets. 
		</div>
            <p>Writing goals can be time consuming and difficult; to facilitate the process, the SMART approach is often used. This approach specifies the characteristics 
                of an ideal (or appropriate) goal, with the acronym letters highlighting that goals need to be <b>specific, measurable, achievable, relevant/realistic</b> and 
                <b>timed</b><sup>36</sup>.  </p>

            <p><i>
                It can be useful to ask the PwMS to set out three columns with the first column headed “Things I must do/have”, the second column headed “Things that others 
                can do/share for me” and the third column headed “Things that can be discarded”. For example; a must do for many of us is to earn our living, a shared 
                thing might be housework, walking the dog or collecting children from school. A discarded thing may be a domestic chore or manual labour. This can help 
                PwMS focus on what they need, what they want and what might be let go.</i>
