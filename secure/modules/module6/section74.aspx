        <h2>7.4 Mood disorders</h2>
        <h3><i>7.4.1	Background</i></h3>
        <p>Over half of PwMS experience mood disorders, with depression being the most frequently reported<sup>233,234,235</sup>. Depression is a major contributor to the 
            decline in QoL and employment in PwMS and may be a consequence of, or reaction to the disease. Aspects of care and support for mood disorders <b>are 
            reviewed in module 5 and treatment for depression is outlined in module 4</b>. Research in MS has generally tended to focus on depressive symptoms, and 
            while health care professionals do not necessarily need to be able to differentiate the specific mood disorders, they should be familiar and watchful 
            of the associated symptoms. </p>
        <h3><i>7.4.2	Assessment</i></h3>
        <p>Early recognition and treatment of mood disorders is important. Whenever possible depression should be assessed during routine clinical evaluations 
            by an MDR team member qualified to do so (e.g., psychologist). Measuring instruments such as the subjective Beck Depression Inventory and the more 
            objective Hamilton Depression Scale may be useful for screening at risk individuals<sup>236</sup>. </p>

            <p><i>There are a number of validated and abbreviated scoring tools that will help the busy clinician identify depression in everyday practice and initiate prompt referral to appropriate expertise. For example: </i>               
            </p>
              <p><i>http://www.cqaimh.org/pdf/tool_phq2.pdf  The Patient Health Questionnaire 2</i></p>
              <p><i>https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg90     NICE CG 90 </i></p>
              <p><i>It is important to consider that low mood may indicate a relapse rather than a reaction, and may need to be treated as such.</i></p>
        </div>
        <h3><i>7.4.3	Rehabilitation</i></h3>
        <p>To date the effects of depression on rehabilitation in MS has not been comprehensively researched but depression has been found to have a negative impact on 
            rehabilitation outcomes in other conditions such as stroke<sup>237</sup>. Evidence suggests that depression in MS left untreated will not improve<sup>238</sup>. Since depression and 
            emotional distress are associated with participation restrictions, the MDR team should be prepared to assess and adapt interventions if required. Such 
            accommodations can include<sup>239</sup>:</p>
        <div>
            <ul class="noindent">
                <li><span>Discussing a PwMS’ self-determination in completing their recommended treatment and adapting and modifying plans so they are 
                    appropriately paced; the PwMS needs to be reasonably confident that they can adhere to the treatment – this can involve starting the 
                    plan with more simple expectations which can be increased over time.</span></li>
                <li><span>Offering more frequent appointments to PwMS having trouble following through intervention exercises in their home environment. </span></li>
                <li><span>Collaboration of family members to support treatment efforts.</span></li>
                <li><span>Reaching out to PwMS who discontinue treatment prematurely. Encourage sensible use of diary reminders and <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1">apps</a>  to promote 
                    adoption of prescribed rehabilitative interventions.</span></li>
                
            </ul>

                  Numerous smartphone apps developed for PwMS are now available. For example, MyMSTeam is an app for people without a local MS support group. 
                    MyMSTeam lets a PwMS assemble their own social network of PwMS using the app. Click on the below link to view the top 10 MS apps 0f 2017

        <p>Antidepressant drugs will take several weeks/months to reach maximum effect; a combination of both medication and psychotherapy has proved to be more 
            suitable for dealing with depression associated with MS<sup>240</sup>. <b>See module 4 for a review of pharmacological treatments for depression in MS.</b> 
            Non-pharmacological based interventions to treat MS associated depression include:</p>
        <ul>
                <li><span>individual counselling sessions and/or sessions together with a close relative (e.g., parent, partner)</span></li>
                <li><span>group counselling sessions for homologous groups (e.g. newly diagnosed patients)</span></li>
                <li><span>provision of written information about normal psychological reactions</span></li>
                <li><span>attending courses on how to live with MS as well as on more specific topics such as sexuality, fatigue, cognitive problems and their management</span></li>
                <li><span>interventions in the form of art <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup2">therapy</a>, <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup3">horticulture therapy</a>, <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup4">music therapy</a>  and yoga</span></li>
                <li><span>exercise training – evidence supports it improving depressive symptoms in PwMS<sup>241</sup> </span></li>

                 The purpose of art therapy is to relieve stress, communicate emotions, and restore a sense of control and confidence. Although a broad term, art 
                    therapy typically refers to any type of artistic expression that is guided by an educated therapist.  Art therapy can:</p>
             <ul><li>Help alleviate symptoms of anger, stress, and depression; in turn, PwMS may find new energy that helps reduce their depression and fatigue</li></ul>
            <ul><li>Benefit PwMS who feel isolated, anxious and depressed by joining them together with a group of people who understand their feelings and symptoms </li></ul>

                 Horticultural therapy is the engagement of a person in gardening activities, facilitated by a trained therapist, to achieve specific therapeutic 
                    treatment goals. It can alleviate depression, improve motor skills, encourage work adjustment, social interaction and communication, teach 
                    problem solving, develop self-confidence and enhance self-esteem.</p> </div>

                  Music therapy is the use of music to maintain, restore, or improve physical, emotional, psychosocial and neurological function. Certain components 
                    of music such as tones or certain beat and rhythm patterns can help with stress, pain and spasticity. Rhythm can also aid balance and co-ordination.</p>

        <p>As discussed throughout this module, exercise is a readily modifiable factor with a positive side effect profile in comparison to pharmacotherapy which 
            can have a negative one. The MDR team should consider (if applicable to the individual) suggesting PwMS engage in exercise training as an approach for 
            potentially preventing and for alleviating symptoms of depression<sup>242</sup>.</p>
        <p>Depression and anxiety in caregivers is common, which increases the stress on the PwMS and vice versa. Group counselling sessions for caregivers, 
            relatives and partners should be offered to allow for sharing feelings and experiences. </p>
