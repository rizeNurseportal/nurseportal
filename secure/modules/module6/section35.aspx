        <h2>3.5 Rehabilitation for relapsing remitting MS (RRMS)</h2>
        <p>The majority (85%) of PwMS<sup>62</sup> initially experience relapses with complete or near-complete recovery interspersed with periods of clinical remission. 
            Although some PwMS may have only minimal symptoms, the majority develop disability over time. This is a result of incomplete recovery from relapses 
            and/or conversion to a progressive course of the disease. Rehabilitation challenges will therefore arise according to the disease course a PwMS 
            is experiencing. </p>
        <p><b>See module 2 for more information on the different types/courses of MS</b></p>
        <p>For PwMS characterised as having the relapsing remitting phenotype, levels of physical and cognitive impairment can vary, highlighting the importance of MDR. </p>
   <p>Following a relapse, rehabilitative interventions and goals can be refined to target and alleviate specific intensified symptoms. Isolated muscle 
       strengthening can be a useful method in targeting specific weaknesses. Hip weakness is a common symptom affecting walking ability. Rehabilitation via a 
       progressive resistance strength training programme using exercise bands can strengthen muscles which may feel weakened during a relapse<sup>63</sup>. Such training may 
       act to prevent future ambulatory dysfunctions. </p>
        <p>If restorative rehabilitation cannot adequately restore previous functionality, rehabilitation to compensate for lost or diminished abilities may be 
            necessary. The aim of compensatory rehabilitation is to educate and coach PwMS on how to compensate for any novel physical or cognitive dysfunctions – 
            manifested following a relapse or progression of symptoms<sup>64</sup>. </p>
        <p>Compensatory interventions can consist of providing coaching in the use of alternative methods and techniques to perform activities. There are an array 
            of assistive devices and aids to help in compensating for symptoms that a person with RRMS may experience.</p>
        <p>For example, if there is weakness in the muscles surrounding the foot and ankle there will likely be ‘foot drop’ and a compensatory technique provided 
            in the form of an ankle orthosis. This can also be used to diminish the effects of spasticity by tilting the foot upward and it will keep the foot from 
            turning inward or outward as well as reducing ‘foot drop’. In addition to weakness, the brace will reduce imbalance and wear and tear on involved joints.</p>

        <p>In recent years, evidence has accumulated that physical exercise can improve fatigue, oxygen consumption, various aspects of QoL, depression and walking 
            distance in PwMS<sup>65,66,67,68</sup>. A recent German study highlighted that rehabilitation via long-term endurance exercise improves aerobic capacity in patients 
            with RRMS which in turn improved levels of fatigue<sup>69</sup>. </p>
