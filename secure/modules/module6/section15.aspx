        <h2>1.5 Importance of multidisciplinary rehabilitation</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                The rehabilitation process considers dysfunctions, disabilities and functional limitations present in the individual PwMS, as derived from the ICF<sup>22</sup>.
                Helping a PwMS achieve their maximum level of functionality depends upon a full assessment of medical, psychological and social issues; these diverse needs 
                are difficult for a single therapist to assess<sup>1</sup>. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation has been shown to have a positive effect on measures of 
                functional independence including sphincter control and self-care<sup>26</sup>. By adopting a multidisciplinary approach to MS rehabilitation, a PwMS will have 
                the opportunity to be assessed by rehabilitation professionals from a range of disciplines (e.g. vocational therapist, physiotherapist, social worker) 
                increasing the efficacy of rehabilitative interventions (figure 2)<sup>1</sup>. The most important point to remember is that the PwMS is at the heart 
                of the team and improving their QoL should be the focus of all team members.

            <p>
                Communicate effectively with all the rehabilitation team, and place the PwMS at the centre of that team. A weekly meeting, or circulated progress 
                report will keep all team members informed. Think about who the wider “team members” might include; such as family/friends, employers, tutors, 
                line managers or maybe local gym staff if community resources are being used. People do not exist in a rehabilitation “bubble”; they live in the world, 
                so be mindful of who has a role to play.

            Because of the multidisciplinary approach to rehabilitation, this module has been developed with the whole team in mind and is therefore intended as a foundation resource for all rehabilitation professionals such as physiatrists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech therapists, neurologists, nurses, and others involved in the management and rehabilitation of PwMS.

            <h3>1.5.1	The role of the nurse</h3>
            <p>
                The MS Nurse, along with the other healthcare professionals within the team, has a central role throughout a PwMS’s rehabilitation (Figure 3)<sup>27</sup>. The nurse can be involved in 
                many aspects of care from helping the PwMS think about their therapeutic goals to helping to implement short- and/or long-term rehabilitation programmes. 
            The MS Nurse will often be the ‘glue’ of the multidisciplinary rehabilitation team; acting to combine the recommendations and instructions from the 
            various professionals in the team into realistic and cohesive strategies. The MS Nurse also has an important role in educating the PwMS. From the time 
            of diagnosis (and throughout the trajectory of the disease) the MS Nurse helps to keep the PwMS informed regarding the substantial roles physical, 
            cognitive and emotional rehabilitation have on MS management.

        <h2>Relationship with the PwMS</h2>
        <p>The nurse involved in the rehabilitation of the PwMS is a ‘change agent’ and patient advocate and champion, who enables the PwMS and important others to 
            interpret, evaluate, determine and agree problems, and identify the strategies and behaviours that will achieve good outcomes. </p>
        <p>The nurse remains a consistent, supportive presence throughout the journey of the PwMS. The nurse acts as navigator and broker to ensure the PwMS is able 
            to access the right rehabilitation resource at the right time and in the right way. The information and ongoing support provided by the nurse is often a 
            determining factor in the ability of the PwMS to understand and follow through with the treatment recommendations of the members of the rehabilitation team.</p>
        <p>An important role of the nurse is to promote self-care and achievable independence among PwMS. The nurse uses a collaborative approach that incorporates 
            abilities of the PwMS to make decisions about his or her healthcare to foster achievement of a high QoL.</p>
        <h2>
            Coordinator of care
        </h2>
       <%-- <p>From initial contact and across the MS trajectory, the nurse will assess, evaluate and convey the status, needs and interventions of the PwMS to members of 
            the rehabilitation team. </p>--%>
        <p>The nurse acts as a feedback loop for the team with a unique 360-degree view of the PwMS; their global health status, personal characteristics and assets, 
            societal and economical needs and support infrastructures. For example, the nurse should alert other team members to early signs of 
            cognitive changes that might interfere with the treatment plan and rehabilitation. The nurse can also help in detecting problems and barriers around the psychosocial needs of the PwMS’s support 
            system, family relationships and communication, and employment situation. The nurse also determines the PwMS’s need for personal assistance in terms of help 
            with personal care and/or household management. </p>
        <p>The nurse is most likely (BUT not always) to have the most intimate professional relationship with the PwMS. This enables them to advocate for timely, relevant 
            and cost-effective co-ordination of rehabilitation interventions that meet identified needs and place the PwMS at the heart of the team.</p>

            <p>
                Motivational interviewing, life coaching and regular validation are part of the nurse’s role in rehabilitation. It is also useful to “step outside” the medical model and consider non-medical activities alongside prescribed rehabilitation; such as art, singing or creative writing. It is important to encourage a balance of rest and relaxation alongside effort and to ensure things like sleep hygiene and nutrition are assessed as part of the rehabilitation process.
