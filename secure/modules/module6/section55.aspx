            <li><span>Rehabilitation for MS-related fatigue can consist of exercise, ECM and CBT interventions</span></li>
             <li><span>Recent studies have found non-pharmacological interventions for treating MS-related fatigue to be efficacious in alleviating fatigue in PwMS; of these CBT has been found to be more beneficial than exercise and ECM</span></li>
            <li><span>Exercise interventions should not be disregarded. They have wide reaching impact on various aspects of MS rehabilitation including fatigue</span></li>
            <li><span>Endurance focused exercise interventions may be more efficacious than PRT for alleviating MS-related fatigue</span></li>
             <li><span>Speech and communication dysfunctions can lead to social isolation and depression; rehabilitation should begin as soon symptoms arise</span></li>

           Thinking about the PwMS you see on a day to day basis, how much does fatigue impact their daily living and participation? Is this the major factor affecting them, or do you see other symptoms of MS impacting upon their ability to participate in daily life?
