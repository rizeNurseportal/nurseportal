        <h2>3.10 Teriflunomide</h2>
        <h2>3.10.1 Introduction</h2>
        <p>Teriflunomide, an oral DMT, was approved in August 2013 for the treatment of RRMS. It prevents the 
        division of rapidly-dividing cells from progressing into the DNA replication phase of the cell cycle. As T 
        lymphocytes are rapidly-dividing cells, they are affected by teriflunomide so there are fewer to invade the 
        CNS and attack neurones.</p>

        <h2>3.10.2 Efficacy</h2>
        <p>Results of the TEMSO trial showed a significant reduction in annualized relapse rate and sustained accumulation of disability with both 7mg and 14 mg daily doses vs placebo<sup>107</sup>. Both doses of teriflunomide reduced annual relapse rate by about one third compared to placebo. The higher dose (14 mg daily) reduced the risk of disability progression (sustained for 12 weeks) by 30%. 
        </p>
        

        <p>A second trial, TOWER, showed a significant reduction in annualized relapse rates and sustained accumulation of disability with the 14-mg dose vs placebo<sup>108</sup>. The higher dose reduced relapse rates by 36% compared to placebo and reduced the risk of disability progression (sustained for 12 weeks) by 31.5%. Key results from these two trials are displayed in table 18.

        <p>A third phase 3 trial, TENERE, compared two doses of teriflunomide with interferon beta 1a in 324 people over two years<sup>109</sup>. Teriflunomide failed to show statistically significant superiority over interferon in reducing the risk of treatment failure (the study’s primary composite endpoint). At the higher teriflunomide dose (14 mg), 37.8% of patients had confirmed relapse or permanent treatment discontinuation over a period of 2 years compared with 42.3% of the interferon-treated patients. Overall, patients reported greater satisfaction and less fatigue with teriflunomide than with IFNβ-1a.</p>

        <p>The most recently reported phase 3 trial “TOPIC” looked at the effect of teriflunomide versus placebo in patients with first clinical symptom of MS<sup>110</sup>. The study randomly assigned 618 patients with CIS to 7 mg or 14 mg of oral teriflunomide once daily or placebo. The average duration of teriflunomide exposure in TOPIC was approximately 16 months. The study reported that teriflunomide significantly reduced the risk for conversion to clinically definite MS in patients with CIS. Results showed a 37% reduction vs placebo in conversion to clinically definite MS (the primary endpoint) with the 7-mg dose and a 43% reduction with the 14-mg dose. There was also a significant 30% to 35% reduction in the key secondary endpoint of new clinical relapse or lesion on MRI with both doses.</p>
        <p>Together with outcomes from TEMSO and TOWER, these findings support the beneficial effect of teriflunomide in patients with RRMS early and later in their disease course.</p>

        <h3>3.10.3 Adverse Events</h3>
        <p>
            The most common adverse events associated with treatment included increased alanine aminotransferase levels, alopecia, diarrhea, influenza, nausea, and paresthesia. Teriflunomide is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment, on the basis of postmarketing reports of severe liver injury, including fatal liver failure in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with leflunomide.

        <h3>3.10.4 Nursing Considerations</h3> 
        <p>
            Health-related warnings for teriflunomide include that of elevated liver enzymes and possible hepatoxicity and risk of teratogenicity. Therefore, there are a number of laboratory tests which need to be conducted prior to, and during, treatment.

        <p>CBC, complete blood count; LFT, liver function test.</p>
        <p>Table: Safety monitoring guidelines for teriflunomide</p>

        <p>Patients should be advised to notify their nurse immediately if they experience symptoms of liver problems (nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, loss of appetite, tiredness, skin or whites of eyes yellowing, dark urine), serious skin problems (redness or peeling), infection (fever, tiredness, body aches, chills, nausea, vomiting), or interstitial lung disease (cough, dyspnea, with or without fever) occur.</p>

        <p>Patients should also be instructed to notify healthcare professional if symptoms of peripheral neuropathy (numbness and tingling in hands and feet different from symptoms of MS), kidney problems (flank pain), high potassium level (nausea or racing heartbeat), or high BP occur. It is also important that patients consult their healthcare professional before taking any new medications. Instruct patient to avoid vaccinations with live vaccines during and following therapy without consulting healthcare professional.</p>


        <h3>Contraception and pregnancy </h3>
        <p>Based on data in animal studies, there is an increased risk of having a baby with birth defects if teriflunomide is taken during pregnancy. The FDA categorizes teriflunomide into pregnancy risk category X.  Teriflunomide remains in the blood for a long time after stopping treatment, so this risk may continue for up to two years. Women of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test before drug therapy. They must also use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for two years after stopping teriflunomide. </p>


        <p>Women who suspect that they are pregnant while taking teriflunomide, or in the two years after stopping treatment, should contact their healthcare provider immediately for a pregnancy test. If the test confirms pregnancy, the blood level of teriflunomide can be reduced rapidly to safe levels by taking certain medicines (cholestyramine or activated charcoal). Women who wish to become pregnant should stop taking teriflunomide. The removal of teriflunomide can be speeded up using the medicines described above. A blood test can confirm that levels of teriflunomide are low enough that it is safe to attempt to become pregnant.</p>

        <p>Males are cautioned not to father a child while on therapy as teriflunomide may be transmitted in semen and the degree of transvaginal absorption is not well characterized. Therefore all individuals taking teriflunomide should practice strict contraception.</p>
