		<div class="icon_summary">                
			<ul class="noindent">
                <li><span>A number of DMTs are available for patients with RRMS suitable for use in those with 
                            CIS or mild disease activity, those with highly active disease, and also for those 
                            who fail first-line therapy.  </span></li>
                <li><span>For most patients with RRMS initial therapy will be IFNβ or glatiramer. These require 
                            administration by SC or IM injection and the MS Nurse plays an important role in 
                            training patients how to self-administer their DMT, either using a syringe and needle, 
                            or an autoinjector.  </span></li>
                <li><span>In some settings the oral agent fingolimod is an alternative to IFNβ or glatiramer for 
                            RRMS, while in others fingolimod is used for patients who progress on first-line 
                            therapy (e.g. IFNβ) or those with highly active RRMS. </span></li> 
                <li><span>For patients with SPMS who continue to experience relapses, IFNβ-1b has been used, and 
                            some centres will continue a patient on their existing DMT while there is clinical 
                            benefit.  Mitoxantrone may also be used in SPMS, although due to concerns about 
                            long-term toxicity, for a defined duration of time.</span></li>
                <li><span>It is important to inform patients of likely adverse events, how to manage the more 
                            common events and when they should report specific events to their MS Centre or 
                            primary care physician. </span></li>
                <li><span>In addition, each DMT has different requirements for routine follow-up assessments and 
                            tests and it is important patients are informed and followed-up appropriately to ensure 
                            these are undertaken as required.</span></li>
