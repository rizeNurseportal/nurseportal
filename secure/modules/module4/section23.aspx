        <p>
           MS can present in different ways and for many the initial symptoms are non-specific; for example sensory problems or optic neuritis which may resolve without intervention.  A diagnosis of CIS or clinically definite MS may be made at this point (see Module 3: Diagnosis) and patients may require symptomatic management of their 
            acute symptoms as described in section 4 (Treating symptoms of MS).  Alternatively, for individuals 
            presenting with symptoms of relapse, treatment may require high dose corticosteroid therapy, as described 
            in section 2.4 (Relapse).
