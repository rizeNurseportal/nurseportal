        <h3>3.5.1 Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Interferon beta (IFNβ) is one of the longest established DMTs for MS.  Both IFNβ-1a and IFNβ-1b are 
            available and there are different formulations which are administered by different routes 
            (subcutaneously - SC or intramuscular - IM).  The specific recommendations for dosing vary 
            with product as summarised in Table 4. Pegylated interferon beta-1a is a molecule in which polyethylene glycol is attached to interferon beta-1a. This drug is administered subcutaneously. The pegylation increases stability, half-life, and peak concentration compared with standard interferon beta-1a. It has recently been approved for treatment of RRMS, with less frequent dosing and similar efficacy compared with currently available first-line injectable treatments. The pegylated interferon is administered once every 2 weeks with a pen-type autoinjector<sup>70</sup>.

            3.5.2 Efficacy</h3>
        <p>
            In clinical trials, as patients with different disease characteristics and baseline severity were 
            enrolled, the pivotal trials of all IFNβ products showed similar efficacy over placebo 
            (Table 5)<sup>72</sup>. In general these studies reported a reduction in annual relapse rate of 
            approximately one-third, with a median time to the first relapse of nearly 1 year and around 
            one-third of patients remaining relapse-free during the study.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although these data cannot determine an effect on an individual patient, it is possible to say that 
            overall, a patient is about one-third less likely to suffer a relapse over 1 year<sup>71</sup>.

        <p>
            Clinical trials have directly compared IFNβ formulations/doses<sup>72,73</sup> and IFNβ against 
            glatiramer<sup>74,75</sup>.  There is some evidence that higher doses of IFNβ may be more efficacious 
            than lower doses<sup>73</sup> but this is conflicting<sup>75</sup>. Therefore, selection of IFNβ 
            product may be driven by physician and/or patient choice. For those who prefer an autoinjector the 
            available device and their preference (e.g. for a more ‘technical’ vs. ‘medical’ device) may also 
            be important<sup>76,77</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Long-term use of IFN in patients with RRMS has been shown to delay progression to SPMS, for example 
            in the ‘LTF Study’, SPMS onset was delayed by over 6 years in those receiving continuous 
            IFNβ-1b (Figure 6)<sup>78,79</sup>.

            Patients with SPMS who continue to suffer highly active disease, defined as continued relapse episodes, 
            may receive IFNβ-1b EOD<sup>81,82</sup> or IFNβ-1a TIW. However, low dose (weekly) IFNβ-1a was not 
            found to be effective<sup>83,84</sup>.

            3.5.3 Adverse Events</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to teaching patients to self-inject, patients receiving IFNβ should be educated about 
            potential adverse events. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Common events include flu-like symptoms, which are most frequent during the start of therapy, and 
            injection site reactions (Table 6).  Gradual titration of the dose of IFNβ and use of paracetamol 
            (acetaminophen) can reduce flu-like symptoms. Patients should also be reassured that these symptoms 
            are to be expected and, looking to the ‘positive’, related to how interferon works. Rotation of the 
            injection site reduces the severity and risk of injection site reactions while use of an autoinjector 
            can also help<sup>77</sup>.

            Depression is a concern with IFN-treated patients as this can be severe in some patients. However, 
            it can be difficult to distinguish between reactive depression (for example due to a patient’s 
            diagnosis, or to a relapse episode or life event) and that related to IFNβ.  Prompt assessment, 
            either by a patient’s MS team or primary care provider, should be arranged for patients with 
            significant symptoms of depression.

            3.5.4 Laboratory Tests</h3>
        <p>
            Interferon beta can affect the blood count (leukocytes and neutrophils) and liver function tests 
            (PIs). It is important that baseline bloods are taken before commencing treatment and then at 
            regular intervals whilst on treatment.

        <p>
            Although relatively uncommon, patients with thyroid abnormalities at baseline, or who develop 
            signs and symptoms suggestive of hyper- or hypo-thyroidism, should have thyroid function tests 
            undertaken regularly<sup>81,82</sup>.

        <h3>
            3.5.5 Neutralising Antibodies</h3>
        <p>
            Patients receiving protein-based therapies, such as interferon beta and natalizumab may raise 
            antibodies to these proteins.  In general these are divided into ‘binding’ and ‘neutralising’ 
            antibodies (BAb and NAb respectively).  BAbs can affect the pharmacokinetics of the protein, 
            however NAbs interfere with target receptor binding and thus can reduce the efficacy of 
            therapy<sup>85,86</sup>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In general the risk of raising NAbs to a therapeutic protein is influenced by a number of patient 
            and product factors. These include the route, dose and frequency of administration, the amino acid 
            composition of the protein (i.e. how ‘foreign’ it is), and the specific formulation, including the 
            presence of stabilising proteins such as human serum albumin or contaminant proteins<sup>87</sup>. 
            In addition, factors such as storage may also play a role since this can promote the formation of 
            aggregates which increase the immunogenicity of a compound. Furthermore the impact of NAbs and BAbs 
            is dependent on their relative ‘titers’ and persistence<sup>86</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In general it is not possible to predict which patients may develop NAbs, or the clinical implications 
            of developing an antibody response. However, NAbs may be suspected in patients who lose response to 
            therapy after an initial good response.  In clinical practice, it is unusual to test for NAbs since 
            management is not affected by the results; for patients losing response, but who are remaining compliant, 
            it is appropriate to ‘step up’ therapy to a second line agent.A recent study investigated whether access to antibody (Ab) test results would alter usual care of IFNβ-treated patients and whether BAb could predict NAb<sup>87</sup>. Therapy changes differed between the Ab testing and usual care arms (19.6% and 14.0%, respectively; p = 0·004). Access to Ab test results impacted therapy management. BAb titres can predict NAb positivity in patients on high-dose IFNβ.
