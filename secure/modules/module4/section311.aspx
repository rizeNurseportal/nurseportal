        <h2>3.11 Dimethyl Fumarate</h2>
        <h2>3.11.1 Introduction</h2>
        <p>Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is the most recently approved oral DMT for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS. The starting dose of DMF is 120 mg by mouth twice daily for 7 days, and then increased to 240 mg by mouth twice daily. DMF has demonstrated efficacy as a first-line therapy and should be considered as such in treatment selection for individuals with RRMS. DMF is thought to work in MS by several potential mechanisms. It has been found to induce T-cell apoptosis, potentially protect against oxidative stress, inhibit adhesion molecules, and potentially shift the immune response toward a Th-2 (helper T-cell) response.</p>

        <h2>3.11.2 Efficacy</h2>
        <p>The DEFINE (Determination of the Efficacy and Safety of Oral Fumarate in RRMS) study compared DMF 240 mg twice daily against placebo<sup>111</sup>. The primary endpoint of the study was met, with the proportion of patients who relapsed by the end of 2 years being 27% for DMF and 46% for placebo (P<0.001). Additionally, secondary endpoints of annualised relapse rate and time to disability progression were significant. The annualised relapse rate was 0.17 for DMF and 0.36 for placebo (P<0.001) consistent with a relative reduction of 53% for the DMF arm, and confirmed disability progression occurring throughout the 2-year study was 16% for DMF and 27% for placebo (P=0.005). Further, MRI measures of new or enlarging T2 lesions and the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions were significantly reduced with DMF compared with placebo.

         <p>CONFIRM (Comparator and an Oral Fumarate in RRMS) compared DMF 240 mg twice daily against placebo and included an open-label reference comparator of glatiramer acetate 20 mg subcutaneously once daily<sup>112</sup>. The primary endpoint of annualised relapse rate, was significantly lower for DMF 0.22 twice daily with 0.29 for glatiramer acetate, and 0.4 for placebo, demonstrating a relative reduction of 44% for dimethyl fumarate (p<0.001), and 29% for glatiramer acetate (p=0.01). There were also significant reductions in new or enlarging T2 lesions in all treatment arms as compared with placebo (p<0.001 for each comparison). In contrast with the DEFINE study, there was no significant difference in disability progression when compared with placebo in CONFIRM </p>

         <p>There have been no head-to-head clinical trials comparing DMF with other DMTs. Nevertheless, Hutchinson et al recently performed a meta-analysis using mixed treatment comparisons<sup>113</sup>. Mixed treatment comparisons are typically used in the absence of sufficient direct head-to-head comparisons allowing for analysis across clinical trials. The investigators analysed data from 27 randomized clinical trials of disease-modifying treatments using standard FDA-approved dosages and demonstrated that DMF 240 mg twice daily significantly reduces the annualized relapse rate as compared with placebo, IFN, glatiramer acetate, and teriflunomide. No significant difference was found when comparing DMF with fingolimod. Natalizumab was superior to DMF in reducing the annualized relapse rate in this meta-analysis.</p>

        <h3>3.11.3 Adverse Events</h3>
        <p>
            DMF may cause flushing (e.g. warmth, redness, itching, and/or burning sensation). 40% of patients taking DMF reported flushing which was mostly mild to moderate in severity. Taking DMF with food may reduce flushing. DMF may also cause gastrointestinal (GI) events (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dyspepsia). The most common GI events reported in clinical studies were: abdominal pain (18% vs 10%), diarrhea (14% vs 11%), nausea (12% vs 9%). The incidence of side effects decreased with time on therapy. DMF was not associated with an increased risk of malignancy, serious infections, or opportunistic infections.
        </p>

         <p>
             A case of PML has been reported in a person who had been taking dimethyl fumarate<sup>114</sup>. The person, who subsequently died of complications from pneumonia, had been taking dimethyl fumarate for more than four years. It is not yet clear whether dimethyl fumarate was directly responsible or whether other factors caused this case of PML. Biogen is working with the regulatory authorities to ensure that prescribing information for dimethyl fumarate includes appropriate warnings.

        <h3>3.11.4 Nursing Considerations</h3> 
        <p>
           A complete blood count is recommended prior to initiation of DMF, and should be repeated annually for safety monitoring. Additional CBC counts should be obtained if clinically indicated. Withholding dimethyl fumarate therapy should be considered if the patient develops a serious infection<sup>115</sup>.
        </p>

         <p>Urinalysis should be performed before initiating treatment with DMF, after 6 months of treatment, then every 6 to 12 months, and as clinically indicated. Liver transaminases should also be checked (within 6 months) before initiating treatment. During treatment, evaluation of transaminases is recommended after 6 months of treatment, then every 6 to 12 months and as clinically indicated<sup>115</sup>.</p>
        
         <p>Dimethyl fumarate can be taken with or without food; however, administration with food may reduce the incidence of flushing. Capsules should be swallowed whole and intact and not crushed or chewed; the contents of an open capsule should not be sprinkled on food. Pretreatment with aspirin can decrease the incidence and severity of flushing, but this method is not mentioned in the product labeling.</p>

         <p>Dimethyl fumarate is classified in Pregnancy Category C; there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal studies found problems with offspring survival, growth, sexual maturation, and neurobehavioral functions. All female patients beginning treatment with DMF should therefore be counselled regarding use of adequate contraception. If a pregnancy occurs during treatment with dimethyl fumarate therapy, the patient should be encouraged to enroll in the Tecfidera Pregnancy Registry<sup>115</sup>.</p>
