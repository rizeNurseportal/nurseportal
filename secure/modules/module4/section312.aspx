        <h2>3.12 Alemtuzumab</h2>
        <h2>3.12.1 Introduction</h2>

        <p>Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, approved in September 2013 for the treatment of adult patients who have RRMS with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features. Alemtuzumab has a novel dosing and administration schedule consisting of 2 annual treatment courses. The first course is given as an intravenous infusion over 5 consecutive days, and the second over 3 days 12 months later.</p>

        <h2>3.12.2 Efficacy</h2>
        <p>Two pivotal randomized phase 3 studies compared treatment with alemtuzumab to high-dose subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in patients with RRMS who had active disease and were either new to treatment (CARE-MS I) or who had relapsed while on prior therapy (CARE-MS II). In CARE-MS I, alemtuzumab was significantly more effective than interferon beta-1a at reducing annualized relapse rates; the difference observed in slowing disability progression did not reach statistical significance<sup>116</sup>. In CARE-MS II, alemtuzumab was significantly more effective than interferon beta-1a at reducing annualized relapse rates, and accumulation of disability was significantly slowed in patients given alemtuzumab vs interferon beta-1a<sup>117</sup>.

        <p class="figure">Table 25: Key efficacy results from CARE-MS II<sup>117</sup></p>

        <p>A recent study assessed a subgroup of patients in CARE-MS II who had the most active disease — 2 or more relapses in the year before randomisation, and 1 or more baseline gadolinium-enhancing lesions<sup>118</sup>.Results showed that 24% of 101 hard-to-treat patients who received alemtuzumab were disease activity–free at the end of 2 years (P =0.0002) compared with 0% of 42 similarly hard-to-treat patients taking interferon. Disease activity–free was defined as no relapse, no sustained accumulation of disability, as measured by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and no new gadolinium-enhancing lesions or new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions. Therefore, it would appear that alemtuzumab benefits the hardest to treat MS patients.</p>

        <h3>3.12.3 Adverse Events</h3>
        <p>
            The most common adverse effects of alemtuzumab are infusion-associated reactions, infections (upper respiratory tract and urinary tract), lymphopenia, and leukopenia. Serious autoimmune conditions can occur in patients receiving alemtuzumab including thyroid disorders and immune thrombocytopenia, both of which require careful monitoring and management. A comprehensive monitoring risk management program is now in place for all patients treated with alemtuzumab to ensure early detection and management of these autoimmune events. Careful patient selection and structured monitoring programs allow for effective patient management resulting in a favourable risk benefit profile.

        <h3>3.12.4 Nursing Considerations</h3> 
        <p>
            Nurses will need to be aware of all potential side effects of alemtuzumab. Infections and the development of other autoimmune diseases (thyroid abnormalities, ITP, and possibly nephropathies, including Good pasture disease) are the main concerns. Monitoring for early detection of these potential side effects is necessary and will be a key role for the MS Nurse. Such monitoring involves routine laboratory tests and patient education so that side effects can be identified early and managed before significant complications arise. The infrequent administration schedule of alemtuzumab could present a challenge for MS nurses in terms of encouraging patients to maintain communication and routinely follow up<sup>119</sup>.
