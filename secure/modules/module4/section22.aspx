                Most people with MS, apart from those with primary-progressive MS (PPMS), will, at some point during the course of their disease, experience  an acute exacerbation (or relapse) of their symptoms. This may be a relapse from which they completely recover, although over time, some may experience increasing loss of function.
            </p>
            <p>
                The natural disease course results in  most people with RRMS  progressing to secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) during which there is progressive disability with or without superimposed relapses. Similarly, people with PPMS may suffer periods of an acute worsening of symptoms that require treatment but will not experience relapses.
