        <h3>3.9.1 Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The immunosuppressant mitoxantrone has also been studied in people with MS and although not approved 
            in many countries, in the United States and elsewhere it has been approved for use in PRMS 
            [<a href="../module2/section21.aspx" target="_blank" >link to module 2</a>], and it may be used in other settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mitoxantrone is generally given as an intravenous injection at a dose of 12 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 
            three months (Table 16)<sup>102</sup>.

        <h3>3.9.2 Efficacy</h3>
        <p>
            In a study of patients with worsening RRMS or SPMS,<a href="../module2/section25.aspx"> [link to module 2] </a>,  
            mitoxantrone reduced the progression of disability compared with placebo<sup>102</sup>. Although the 
            primary endpoint analysis of this study was different to those used in other DMT trials, assessment 
            of the annualised relapse rate indicated a 63% reduction in year 1 vs. placebo, and 68% for year 2 
            (66% reduction in years 1 and 2 combined).  Just over one-half of patients were relapse free (57%) 
            compared with 37% on placebo at the end of year 2<sup>102</sup>.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Additional smaller studies have confirmed a treatment effect in these populations<sup>103</sup>.
        </p>

        <h3>3.9.3 Adverse Events</h3>
        <p>
            Up to 75% of patients receiving mitoxantrone suffer nausea and vomiting.  In addition to bone marrow 
            suppression (leukopaenia), mitoxantrone is also associated with functional cardiac changes (congestive 
            heart failure, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction<sup>104</sup>.  As a result, it is recommended it 
            should not be used for people with MS who have a left ventricular ejection fraction below the lower 
            limit of normal<sup>105</sup> and monitoring prior to, and during therapy, is undertaken.  This should 
            include evaluation of LVEF and an ECG<sup>105</sup>. A complete blood count is also required prior to each dose.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, for people with MS a cumulative dose of more than 140 mg/m<sup>2</sup> should not be administered<sup>105</sup>; 
            this is equivalent to just over 11 doses at the recommended schedule (12 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), or 3 years’ therapy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In a follow-up of over 800 MS patients who had received mitoxantrone, there was one report of congestive 
            heart failure and 5% of patients had asymptomatic reductions of left ventricular ejection fraction which 
            was persistent in 11 patients. There were also two cases of treatment-related leukaemia<sup>106</sup>. These concerns 
            mean that mitoxantrone is not usually considered as a ‘first line’ therapy for RRMS.

        <h3>3.9.4 Nursing Considerations</h3> 
        <p>
            Mitoxantrone is an immunosuppressant and it is recommended that the preparation and administration follows 
            those steps required for cytotoxic chemotherapy<sup>103</sup>. Doctors should have experience of the use of cytotoxics 
            and it is usually recommended that mitoxantrone is administered as a slow IV infusion to reduce the risk of 
            cardiotoxicity<sup>103</sup>. Patients with nausea and vomiting may benefit from prompt administration of 
            antiemetic therapy, while in some centres these may be given as prophylaxis before the first dose.  As 
            described in section 3.9.3, patient also require ECG assessment and a complete blood count, prior to each 
            dose of mitoxantrone<sup>103</sup>.  During the infusion it is also important to be vigilant to signs of 
            extravasation, since in severe cases this can lead to tissue necrosis<sup>103</sup>.
        </p>
        <div class="keypoint">
            Mitoxantrone is an immunosuppressant which can be used for SPMS, or in those with worsening RRMS. There is a risk 
            of cumulative toxicity to heart function and also leukaemia and therefore the duration of therapy is 
            limited to 3 years.

            <p>
                How would you support the person with MS to achieve reasonable, realistic expectations 
                of proposed treatments?
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="nursetippopup1" class="nursetippopup">
            <p>
                The person with MS needs to understand DMTs reduce the relapse rate by about one third. 
                This means that a person with MS can still experience relapses. No one therapy is effective 
                for all people and it is hard to predict whether the medicine will help a particular individual.
            </p>
            <p>
                Treatment with DMTs is a long term treatment, efficacy is not immediate. People with MS need 
                to understand this, and be reminded of this at every follow up consultation. The nurse can use 
                an analogy of longer term investment – there is no immediate payback but benefits come in time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                People with MS are often very vulnerable and visit dubious websites as they search for a “cure”. 
                It is therefore important to provide people with MS with evidence based, accurate information about 
                treatment options and to supply “good” Internet website addresses.
