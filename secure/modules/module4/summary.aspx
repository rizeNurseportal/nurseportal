			<ul>                
                <li><span>Acute relapse management focuses on the initiation of therapy to resolve 
                        symptoms as required.  </span></li>
                <li><span>This may include symptom management or for acute relapses/exacerbations, 
                        high dose steroid therapy (IV or oral).</span></li>
                <li><span>A number of DMTs are available for patients with RRMS suitable for use in 
                        those with CIS or mild disease activity, those with highly active disease, and 
                        also for those who fail first-line therapy.  </span></li>
                <li><span>For most patients with RRMS initial therapy will be IFNβ or glatiramer. These 
                        require administration by SC or IM injection and the MS Nurse plays an important 
                        role in training patients how to self-administer their DMT, either using a syringe 
                        and needle, or an autoinjector.  </span></li>
                <li><span>In some settings the oral agent fingolimod is an alternative to IFNβ or 
                        glatiramer for RRMS, while in others fingolimod is used for patients who progress 
                        on first-line therapy (e.g. IFNβ) or those with highly active RRMS.  </span></li>
                <li><span>For patients with SPMS who continue to experience relapses, IFNβ-1b has been used, 
                        and some centres will continue a patient on their existing DMT while there is clinical
                         benefit.  Mitoxantrone may also be used in SPMS, although due to concerns about 
                         long-term toxicity, for a defined duration of time.</span></li>
                <li><span>It is important to inform patients of likely adverse events, how to manage the more 
                        common events and when they should report specific events to their MS Centre or 
                        primary care physician. </span></li>
                <li><span>In addition, each DMT has different requirements for routine follow-up assessments 
                        and tests and it is important patients are informed and followed-up appropriately to 
                        ensure these are undertaken as required.</span></li>
                <li><span>In addition to DMT, people with MS may require therapy to improve symptoms of MS 
                        which are both common and troublesome. </span></li>
                <li><span>If untreated these symptoms worsen quality of life and have a significant impact 
                        on the ability to maintain activities of daily living.  </span></li>
                <li><span>The treatment options for symptom management in MS are often based on clinical 
                        experience rather than large clinical trials.  </span></li>
                <li><span>It may be necessary to seek advice from other specialists for complex cases, for    
                        example a urologist for bladder problems.</span></li>
                <li><span>The MS Nurse should be aware of the symptoms a patient may experience, and be prepared 
                        to ask about potentially ‘personal’ symptoms that patients may be reluctant to raise 
                        themselves.</span></li>
                <li><span>This requires the nurse to build a relationship based on trust and to be aware of 
                        the potential treatment options. </span></li>
                <li><span>In addition patients may commonly decide to take complementary and alternative remedies; 
                        it is important the patient’s MS care team is made aware of these therapies in order that 
                        appropriate advice can be given if required.</span></li>
