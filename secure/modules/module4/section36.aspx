        <h3>3.6.1 Introduction </h3>
        <p>
            Glatiramer acetate (glatiramer), like interferon is administered as a daily (20 mg) SC 
            injection (Table 7).  It is often used as first-line therapy for RRMS.

            Pivotal studies of glatiramer vs. placebo reported similar efficacy to IFNβ<sup>71</sup> (Table 8), 
            confirmed by comparative trials which found similar efficacy of glatiramer and IFNβ-1a TIW over 
            96 weeks<sup>75</sup> and IFNβ-1b EOD over 3.5 years<sup>74</sup>.

            Glatiramer has, like IFNβ, been tested in patients with CIS.  In the PreCISe trial, glatiramer 
            was found to reduce the risk of clinically definite MS by 45% over 3 years compared with 
            placebo (Figure 8)<sup>32</sup>.

                    The CombiRx study was conducted to determine whether the combination of GA and IFN would be superior to either agent alone. Combining these two commonly prescribed therapies for MS did not produce a significant clinical benefit over three years. The results of this study confirm the safety of the combination therapy, but do not demonstrate sufficient clinical efficacy to warrant endorsement of this combination of drugs as yet<sup>88</sup>.

            3.6.3 Adverse Events</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to injection site reactions such as erythema and pain, up to one-third of patients treated 
            with glatiramer may experience post-injection reactions such as vasodilatation, chest pain, dyspnoea, 
            palpitations or tachycardia within minutes of the injection<sup>89</sup>. Lipoatrophy is the loss of subcutaneous 
            fat. It appears as large “dents” or depressions in the skin. Athough not common in the PreCise trial (table 8), 
            this has been reported in as many as 45% of patients receiving glatiramer, and affects females more than 
            males<sup>90</sup>. Other reported events include anxiety and depression, nausea and GI disturbances<sup>89</sup>. 
            However in general, glatiramer is well tolerated, as indicated by the experience of patients in the PreCISe 
            trial (Table 9)<sup>32</sup>.

                How do you explain the potential adverse events and their management so that the person 
                with MS can effectively self-manage and also know when they should communicate with the 
                medical team?

        <div id="nursetippopup1" class="nursetippopup">
            <p>
                The MS nurse needs to explain possible adverse effects of treatment as often as is needed.  
                People with MS don’t always realise what you mean; for example they may not understand 
                ‘flu-like’ symptoms until they experience them. Telephone support will often be needed 
                to discuss possible adverse events as patients experience them.
            </p>
            <p>
            The side effects of beta interferon which need to be communicated to the person with MS are:  
            </p>
            <ul>             
                <li><span>Flu-like symptoms</span></li>
                <li><span>Headaches</span></li>
                <li><span>Redness, swelling, or tenderness at the injection site. </span></li>
                <li><span>Depression</span></li>
                <li><span>Anxiety, confusion, and eating and sleeping disturbances</span></li>   
            </ul>
            <p>
                The side effects of immunosuppressants are more severe than those of immunomodulators and 
                patients need particular careful counselling.
