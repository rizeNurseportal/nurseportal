        <h3>4.3.1 Background</h3>
        <p>
            Impaired ability to walk is one of the major signs associated with MS<sup>122</sup>) and may 
            affect more than three-quarters of people with MS<sup>122,123</sup>.  Loss of walking ability leads to 
            patients needing walking assistance or a wheelchair leading to problems with undertaking tasks of 
            daily living and to loss of patient quality of life<sup>123-125</sup>.  Moreover the effect on a patient’s 
            family/caregiver is significant<sup>126</sup>.

        <h3>4.3.2 Management</h3>
        <p>
            The usual approach to management is physical rehabilitation and retraining, with management 
            of any associated spasticity<sup>123</sup>.  Treatment of spasticity can help walking by 
            improving muscle tone but this has no impact on the underlying gait disorder<sup>88</sup>. In advanced 
            stages of MS, wheelchairs or power scooters may be unavoidable<sup>127</sup>.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3.3 Fampridine</h3>
        <p>
            A new treatment approved by the EMEA to <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1">improve walking </a>
            in people with RRMS and SPMS is 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1">fampridine</a>.
            In clinical trials 35% and 43% of patients in two trials were ‘responders’<sup>128,129</sup>. In these 
            patients, walking speed increased by approximately 25% (approximately 15.5 cm/second) over 25 feet 
            (7.62 meters).  This sustained release tablet is taken twice daily, 12 hours apart<sup>130</sup>. 
        </p>
        <div id="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdivepopup">
            The efficacy of fampridine was measured using the ‘Timed 25-foot Walk’ (T25FW) test.  
            The walking speed of patients was timed over 25 feet and a ‘responder’ was defined as a patient with a 
            faster walking speed for at least three of the four visits during treatment compared with the maximum 
            off drug<sup>128,129,131</sup>. The results of two phase III studies were very similar; the proportion of responders 
            was increased with fampridine (34.8% vs 8.3% and 42.9% vs 9.3%, p<0.001 in both studies). Responders 
            increased their walking speed in both studies by approximately 25%, or an increase of approximately 
            0.51 ft/second (approximately 15.5 cm/second). The MS Walking Scale-12 (MSWS-12) was also used to assess 
            patient response and this measure also improved in fampridine-treated patients which was also correlated 
            with ‘response’ as defined using the T25FW primary endpoint.

        <p>
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup2">Fampridine works</a>
            by improving the ability of neurons to transmit a signal and therefore acts to improve 
            the neurological deficits associated with demyelination<sup>129,131,132</sup>.
        </p>
        <div id="deepdivepopup2" class="deepdivepopup">
            The Fampridine is a ‘potassium channel blocker’<sup>131,132</sup> which prolongs the duration of Na++ influx 
            and hence the action potential of nerves, reducing the amount of current necessary to transmit a nerve 
            signal.  In addition, calcium influx at nerve ends is also increased which can improve the conduction 
            of signals to other nerves or muscle<sup>131</sup>.
        </div>
        <p>
            Fampridine is excreted unchanged by the kidneys.  Therefore, while there is no documented risk of interactions 
            with drugs metabolised by the liver, there is a risk of increased levels in patients with renal impairment and 
            fampridine should not be used in patients with creatinine clearances &lt;80 ml/min.  It is suggested that renal 
            function should be assessed in elderly patients prior to starting therapy<sup>130</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although fampridine is usually well tolerated, the mechanism of action of fampridine means that is may cause 
            convulsions (seizures).  Indeed, there have been reports of convulsions during use of fampridine, particularly 
            in early studies of higher doses (e.g. 20 mg) and the clinical trials could not confirm the magnitude of risk 
            with the 10 mg twice daily dose<sup>128-131</sup>.  Patients with a history of convulsions should not receive fampridine<sup>130</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most common adverse events with fampridine are mild and resolve without specific management.  Common events 
            reported include dizziness/balance disorders, tremors, insomnia, anxiety, fatigue, back pain and gastrointestinal 
            disturbance (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation)<sup>128-131</sup>.  
        </p>
        <p>
            There are no reports of pregnancy during use of fampridine, however animal studies have reported adverse effects 
            to the foetus and it is recommended that use of fampridine is avoided in pregnancy<sup>130</sup>.
