        <h3>4.10.1 Background</h3>
        <p>
            Some degree of cognitive impairment is noted in approximately 45–65% of patients with 
            MS<sup>173</sup>. The impairment may start at early stages of the disease and cognition 
            continues to deteriorate with disease progression<sup>174</sup>. The main symptoms of these deficits 
            include problems with concentration, mental exhaustion and fatigue, spurious actions, 
            learning difficulties and forgetfulness.
        </p>

        <h3>4.10.2 Management</h3>
        <p>
            There are no approved drugs for treatment of cognitive deficits in MS. Off-label use of donepezil 
            in 69 people with MS has been reported to have positive effects but this could not be confirmed 
            in a larger trial<sup>175</sup>. A study with memantine was terminated early following evidence of 
            treatment-related worsening of neurological symptoms<sup>176</sup>. Rivastigmine has shown no 
            significant effects on cognitive problems in MS patients in smaller studies so far, but is currently 
            being investigated in a larger multicentre study with 200 patients<sup>177</sup>. Because of the significant impact of cognitive impairment on every aspect of life, early referral for assessment and expert support is paramount.
