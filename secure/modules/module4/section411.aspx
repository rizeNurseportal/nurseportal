        <h3>4.11.1 Background</h3>
        <p>
            Pain is experienced by more people with MS than was previously thought<sup>1</sup>; the most recent 
            estimates suggest around one-half of patients experience a range of symptoms<sup>178</sup> (Table 19). It is often very difficult for people with MS to articulate, or locate, their pain or discomfort.

            <p>
                Acute pain may worsen, or become more frequent as MS progresses.  Paroxysmal pain may occur at 
                any site depending on the nerve affected; <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1"> trigeminal neuralgia  </a>
                may occur in up to 3% of patients<sup>1</sup>.    
            </p>
            <div id="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdivepopup">
                Trigeminal neuralgia is characterised as an ‘electric shock’ like facial sensation which lasts 
                for a few seconds to up to a minute but is experienced repeatedly through the day.  It results 
                from abnormal nerve signalling within the trigeminal nerve which is a major nerve involved in 
                sensation in the face.

            <h3>4.11.2 Management</h3>
            <p>
                Many therapies used for pain in people with MS is based on clinical experience rather than 
                evidence from large scale clinical trials<sup>178</sup>, and a number of agents are used (Table 29).

            For acute paroxysmal pain anticonvulsants represent first line therapy; examples of drugs used 
            include carbamazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin, 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup2"> levetiracetam or lamotrigine </a><sup>180</sup>.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Carbamazepine may cause leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and more rarely, agranulocytosis and anemia. Therefore a pre-treatment blood count is usually recommended<sup>181</sup>.  Patients should also be advised to report any signs or symptoms suggestive of infection (e.g. fever, sore throat) or bruising/skin reactions to their doctor<sup>179</sup>.  Because of the risk of liver function abnormalities it is also usual to check liver function tests and electrolytes before therapy, and periodically during therapy as carbamazepine may also cause severe hyponatriemia<sup>179</sup>.   Patients treated with carbamazepine may suffer more adverse events than those treated with gabapentin or lamotrigine, and discontinuation may be more frequent<sup>178</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pregabalin is a therapy approved for peripheral and central neuropathic pain.  The usual does is 
            150 mg per day given as two or three divided doses which can be increased to 300 mg per day after 
            3 to 7 days, and if needed, to a maximum dose of 600 mg per day after an additional 7-day interval.  
            The adverse events with pregabalin are similar to gabapentin and for people with MS receiving 
            pregabalin it is important to consider whether any visual symptoms are adverse events of therapy, 
            or secondary to their MS.    The higher doses of gabapentin used for neuropathic pain can result 
            in events being more frequent or severe than with pregabalin - although comparative studies have 
            not been done in people with MS.  
        </p>
        <div id="deepdivepopup2" class="deepdivepopup">
            Other agents used (although not approved for neuropathic pain) also have distinct adverse event 
            profiles.  Levetiracetam is associated with nasopharyngitis, somnolence, headache, fatigue and 
            dizziness. In addition, anorexia, mood changes (depression, anxiety, insomnia, and irritability), 
            tremor, gastrointestinal effects and convulsions may occur<sup>182</sup>. However, pre-treatment 
            or on-treatment blood or liver function tests are not normally required. Similarly, lamotrigine 
            can be associated with aggression or irritability, headache, dizziness, tiredness and fatigue, 
            skin rashes and gastrointestinal disturbances<sup>183</sup>.

        <p>
            Treatment of neuropathic pain in people with MS is highly individualised1; for acute paroxysmal 
            pain combination therapy may be required, while trigeminal pain may be treated with anticonvulsants 
            or antispasmodics such as baclofen or misoprostol<sup>1,180,184</sup>. Small studies of treatment 
            options for trigeminal neuralgia suggest that the majority of patients may gain benefit from 
            therapy (carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine)<sup>178</sup>.  Tricyclic antidepressants may also 
            be used for neuropathic pain, although adverse events can be wide ranging and significant (see 
            section Depression)<sup>185</sup>. For those who fail to respond to pharmacotherapy, surgical 
            procedures or microvascular decompression may be considered<sup>178</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall it has been suggested approximately 50% of patients may respond to first line anticonvulsant 
            therapy for neuropathic pain syndromes in MS, however response is highly variable between patients, 
            and requires ongoing review and assessment<sup>178</sup>.

            Lhemitte’s sign is a sensation of ‘electric shock’ like tingling experiences throughout the body, 
            often down the spine when the patient bends their head1. It may occur in one-quarter to one-third 
            of people with MS which if troublesome can be treated with surgery<sup>1</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chronic neuropathic pain is also common in people with MS and, like acute neuropathic pain, 
            anticonvulsants are the usual first-line therapy, with NSAIDs, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants 
            or nerve block<sup>1,180</sup>.  Dystonic spasms can cause both acute and chronic pain and 
            antispasmodics (see section ‘spasticity’) can provide relief.

            Depending on local clinical practice, patients with chronic pain may be able to attend a specialist 
            Pain Clinic for assessment and management. Pain Clinics vary in the treatment/therapies offered and 
            not all centres will have a specific pain clinic.
