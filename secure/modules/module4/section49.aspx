            4.9.1 Background</h3>
        <p>
            Depression will be experienced by over one-half of people with MS at some point in their lifetime<sup>1</sup>.  Depression may be related to underlying disease processes, the challenge of living with MS, DMT therapy, or a combination of these<sup>1</sup>. There are higher levels of anxiety syndromes and suicide risk in people with MS.    
        </p>

        <h3>
            4.9.2 Assessment: Role of the MS Nurse</h3>
        <p>
            People with MS should be assessed for depression during routine clinic visits, and urged 
            to report symptoms to their MS Nurse and/or their general practitioner<sup>1</sup>.  Specific tools/scales 
            are available to detect depression, and assess the severity/need for therapy. Anxiety state is 
            an important factor to consider as it is an indicator of depression risk, which is highest the 
            first 5 years after diagnosis. Studies have found positive correlations between anxiety scores 
            and depression scores, indicating that the two conditions are related. Anxiety has also been 
            shown to be prominent in the period surrounding MS diagnosis disclosure, particularly in 
            women<sup>171,172</sup>.

        <h3>
            4.9.3 Management</h3>
        <p>
            Pharmacologic therapy for depression should be initiated when indicated, and may commonly 
            be with an SSRI or tricyclic antidepressant.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adverse events with SSRI therapy include decreased appetite, somnolence or sleep disturbances, 
            dizziness and tremor, nausea, dry mouth, constipation, diarrhoea, asthenia, increased body 
            weight and sexual dysfunction. Rarely, a neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like event may occur 
            when starting therapy with an SSRI.  Symptoms include hyperthermia and rigidity, myoclonus and 
            confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tricyclic antidepressants are associated with anticholinergic side effects including dry 
            mouth, dilated pupils, hyperpyrexia, urinary retention and constipation. Other events may include 
            dizziness, weakness and anxiety/insomnia.
