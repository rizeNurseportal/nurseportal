        <h3>4.5.1 Background</h3>
        <p>
            Fatigue is reported by most people with MS<sup>1</sup> and significantly impairs quality of 
            life, and also the ability to continue in employment<sup>139,140</sup>.  Up to one-third of people 
            with MS may identify fatigue as their most disabling symptom, and fatigue may lead to the onset, 
            or worsening of other symptoms including depression, loss of cognitive function, and through an 
            effect on exercise, muscle weakness.  
        </p>

        <h3>4.5.2 Management</h3>
        <p>
            Non-pharmacologic therapy for fatigue can include a cooling vest, air conditioned environments 
            and cool showers or cold drinks to reduce elevated body temperature.  In addition, aerobic 
            exercise and occupational therapy can both help patients with fatigue (Figure 14).

            Pharmacologic therapy to alleviate fatigue is with CNS stimulants such as methylphenidate, modafinil, 
            amantadine, and although not available in many markets dextroamphetamine<sup>1 </sup>

        <p>            
            None of these agents are approved for the management of fatigue in people with MS<sup>1,141</sup>, 
            for example methylphenidate is indicated for the treatment of ADHD, modafinil for excessive somnolence 
            in patients with narcolepsy, and amantadine is used for the prophylaxis and treatment of symptoms 
            of influenza.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amantadine is most commonly considered the first-line therapy for fatigue<sup>141,142</sup>.   
            Four short term clinical trials of amantadine have reported the effects of amantadine and reported 
            improvements in fatigue and patient preference for  amantadine over placebo<sup>141,142</sup>. Overall 
            between 20% and 40% of people with MS with mild-moderate fatigue show short-term reduction in fatigue 
            with amantadine<sup>1,2,142</sup>.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Modafinil has been shown to improve fatigue in three main trials<sup>143-45</sup>. However, two additional 
            studies could find no benefit compared with placebo<sup>146,147</sup>.    The European regulatory agency 
            (EMEA) has stated that the risk-benefit of modafinil is positive only for narcolepsy<sup>141</sup>.
