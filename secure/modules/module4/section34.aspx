        <h2>3.4 The Role of the MS Nurse in Supporting Patients Taking DMTs: General 
                Concepts</h2>
        <a id="1" name="1"></a>
        <h3>3.4.1 Role of the MS Nurse in Promoting Adherence</h3>
        <p>
            Patients who do not take disease-modifying therapies (DMT) as prescribed may compromise their 
            future health and raise the risk of more relapses, potentially leading to disability and additional 
            long-term care needs. A recent study found that approximately half of patients with MS discontinued 
            their DMT within 2 years of drug initiation<sup>55</sup>. In addition, a 2010 prospective study using 
            objective methods of adherence measurement found that approximately one-fifth of patients with MS 
            miss over 20% of their scheduled doses<sup>56</sup>. The reasons associated with this include an unpredictable 
            disease course, physical disability, feelings of hopelessness and cognitive impairment, as well as 
            the fact that DMTs do not produce immediate results.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently there has been a shift from a paternalistic prescriber requiring compliance from the patient 
            to adhere to a prescription plan, to that of a partnership with the patient who requires information 
            to make an informed decision whether to embark on a course of medication (concordance). Concordance 
            is a mutual understanding between healthcare provider and patient with regard to a treatment plan, 
            and implies that the patient actively and willingly collaborates with the clinician, and takes responsibility 
            for his/her own healthcare. The informed patient can understand any benefits or risks that may or may 
            not be in conflict with his or her beliefs and attitudes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Patient concordance/adherence to DMTs is an issue that should be addressed from the time of diagnosis 
            throughout the disease course.   In addition, it is vital that those patients taking oral therapy do 
            not as a result, under-estimate their illness and therapy.  The person with MS should be made aware of 
            the importance of concordance/adherence and the need to take their diagnosis and their DMT ‘seriously’.
        </p>

        <div class="keypoint">
            The person with MS should be able to understand and acknowledge the importance of adhering to prescribed treatments and value the benefits of such treatments
        </div>

        <p>
            It is therefore important that the MS Nurse is prepared to explain DMT for the patient; this may 
            include explaining the mechanism of action or adverse events (see later sections).
        </p>
        <p>
            The first stage of promoting adherence is the provision of information. One study shows that 
            less than 50% of patients were satisfied with the information provided to them on the side effects 
            and management of their drugs<sup>57</sup>. Before a patient begins DMT, the healthcare providers must educate 
            the patient and family about the disease course. Education should emphasise the goals of slowing down 
            the progression of disability and reducing the frequency of relapses and disease shown on magnetic resonance 
            imaging. With insightful understanding of the disease process, the patient is better able to make treatment decisions and have more realistic expectations for therapy.
        </p>

                    title="A photo of a couple having a discussion with their nurse"/>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            The decision to start DMT should include a discussion of approved treatment options, routes and schedules 
            of administration, and potential side effects. Comprehensive education of both the patient and his or her 
            family members is essential at this stage to set realistic expectations and discuss effective management 
            strategies<sup>58</sup>. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Educating patients with MS is a strategy of the MS Nurse to facilitate adherence through provision of understandable information, on how the drugs are administered, and benefits and potential side effects of the treatments. Many patients with chronic illness have some doubt about medication and this behaviour can be even more marked when the benefits are not clear or are distant and are not of immediate effect<sup>59</sup>. DMTs are prescribed to patients with MS when they are often in remission, asymptomatic and ambivalent. It is important that the mode of action of reducing relapses is made clear, that there is no immediate benefit as this will only be demonstrated by a reduction in relapse rates. If patients do not understand this they may have unrealistic expectations about the treatment and find coping with side effects difficult, and consequently stop treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Munschauer and Weinstock-Guttman<sup>60</sup> suggest that using a trans-theoretical model of change 
            encourages the continued use of DMTs. The model is based on the idea that an individual’s attitudes 
            and beliefs are dynamic, and concordance with treatment can change at any stage (figure 4). The MS 
            Nurse can intervene at any of the following stages by providing individual information tailored to 
            the attitude of the patient:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span><b>Pre-contemplative stage:</b> The MS Nurse provides information to enable the patient to gain an 
                        understanding of the illness, encouraging him or her to verbalise any educational or 
                        personal barriers to treatment</span></li>
            <li><span><b>Contemplative stage:</b> During this stage the nurse provides information that enables the patient 
                        to describe the process of DMT, as well as the potential benefits and side-effect profile</span></li>
            <li><span><b>Preparation stage:</b> The nurse can evaluate the individual’s learning needs and plan individual 
                        teaching sessions with the use of teaching aids</span></li>
            <li><span><b>Action stage:</b> The nurse will need to supervise the patient at regular monthly intervals 
                        (or more frequently if required) for the first 3–6 months to assess how the patient is coping, 
                        to monitor any side effects and to assess the individual’s injection technique</span></li>
            <li><span><b>Maintenance stage:</b> The patient is considered concordant with treatment during regular 3–6 monthly 
                        follow-up appointments. Here, the nurse can assess any problems the individual may be experiencing 
                        which, if unchecked, may lead to the patient stopping therapy.</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            There are times when a patient may become discouraged with DMT treatment for a number of reasons, including 
            skin site reactions or recurrent flu-like symptoms. It is important that the MS Nurse offers support at these 
            times and encourages people to remain on treatment. Patients with low self-efficacy will benefit from this 
            focused support; they can be encouraged to keep a daily diary that can be discussed at each meeting. Highlighting 
            any unpleasant side effects or problems can provide a feeling of commitment and control. Feeling in control of 
            their medication will further empower patients with MS and achieve concordance.
        </p>
        <p>
            The MS Nurse plays an important role in assisting people with MS to take their DMT as prescribed.  This can 
            include self-injection training and pro-active advice and support if any adverse events occur. The MS Nurse 
            is able to spend time with the patient to demonstrate and teach the self-administration of the subcutaneous 
            or intramuscular injection; one study suggests the MS Nurse may spend up to five hours training the individual 
            in the self-injection techniques and management of side effects, either at home or in a clinical setting<sup>61</sup>. 
            This gives the patient the opportunity to become familiar with the procedure in a relaxed environment and to 
            practice the technique. It also allows the nurse to observe if the patient demonstrates any dexterity or 
            cognitive problems that may have an impact on adherence and self-management. MS Nurses also play an important role in helping patients remain adherent with their prescribed medication, whether this is taken orally or by injection, through established follow-up strategies.
        </p>

        <p>
            A recent UK and Ireland audit of patient adherence to subcutaneous interferon beta-1a injections using the RebiSmart(®) injection device found that mean adherence over the course of 24 months was 95%. This high adherence may be partly attributed to the expert support patients received, supplemented by routine and regular contact from the MySupport patient-support programme<sup>62</sup> (an industry-sponsored programme that provides support to patients with MS who have been prescribed sc IFN β-1a), as well as the self-motivation of patients who persisted with treatment for 2 or more years<sup>63</sup>. A personalised support programme, utilising one-to-one nursing support and additional support materials, can increase the probability of patients with MS remaining on treatment.

            <p>
                What might be some good ways of promoting treatment adherence?
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="nursetippopup1" class="nursetippopup">            
            <p>
                A simple starting point to promote adherence is educating people with MS about the necessity for 
                therapy, while setting realistic expectations. Proper counselling before therapy is initiated 
                can prevent problems with adherence further down the road.  
            </p>
            <p>
                People with MS should be informed that available agents reduce the incidence of relapses and 
                although they do not cure MS, they can help maintain function and quality of life through 
                relapse reduction and delay in progression. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreover, people with MS who are in remission must understand that although they may not be 
                experiencing relapses or signs of progression, the disease may be active at a subclinical 
                level and thus, continuation of therapy is necessary to help reduce disease burden. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Education about injection techniques and about what can reasonably be expected from therapy, 
                and from MS itself, is a key strategy to successfully maintaining treatment adherence 
                and should be an on-going process. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, the value of the regimen and the importance of adherence need to be reinforced repeatedly.  
                Involving the family and friends so they are able to support the person with MS is also an important strategy.
            </p>
            <p>
                When promoting treatment adherence the nurse should be aware of the following:
            </p>
            <ul>            
                <li><span>The two main reasons why people with MS stop therapy are adverse events and lack of efficacy. 
                            Adverse events cause people to stop sooner than the lack of efficacy. No reliable and 
                            specific marker has been found to determine whether DMT therapy is working optimally for 
                            an individual with MS.</span></li>
                <li><span>Some people assume that their treatment is not working when current symptoms do not abate 
                            with regular DMT injections or they experience new symptoms. This perceived lack of 
                            efficacy can be the result of unrealistic treatment expectations. </span></li>

        <h3>3.4.2 Role of the MS Nurse in Helping to Manage Treatment Side Effects</h3>
        <p>
            Side effects of MS medications can influence adherence with prescribed treatment regimens when 
            patients are not aware of the possible side effects and do not know how to manage them. Nurses are 
            in a key position to educate patients about possible side effects and to prevent or minimise them. 
            Often patients are reluctant to begin DMT because of fear of possible side effects that may disrupt 
            their daily lives. Reassuring patients about the many ways to manage side effects is often the first 
            step to getting treatment started.
        </p>
        <p>
            The MS Nurse needs to ensure that the person with MS is fully aware of all possible side effects from 
            the drugs and to know what to do about them should they occur. The most common side effects associated
             with IFNβ therapy include injection-site reactions and flu-like symptoms. Less common side effects 
             include blood disorders, depression, hypertension, nausea and vomiting, raised liver enzymes, skin 
             reactions and spasticity. Other side-effects occur more rarely, and due to variations between different 
             DMTs, it is always advisable to check the prescribing information for each medication.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most common side effects associated with glatiramer acetate are injection-site pain and reactions, 
            and what is commonly referred to as ‘post-injection syndrome’ which consists of chest pain, palpitations 
            and anxiety. Other effects include flushing, constriction of the throat and urticaria. These symptoms are 
            usually transient and do not require specific treatment<sup>64,65</sup>. It is important for the nurse to 
            educate patients and their support partners about this possible reaction. They should attempt to relax, 
            take deep breaths, and wait until it passes, usually about 15 minutes.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most common adverse reactions reported with fingolimod include headache, influenza, diarrhea, back pain, liver transaminase elevation, and cough; teriflunomide adverse reactions include ALT elevation, alopecia, diarrhea, influenza, nausea, and paresthesia; and dimethyl fumarate adverse reactions include flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea.
        </p>
        <h3>3.4.2.1 Injection-site Reactions</h3>
        <p>
            Injection-site reactions include redness, swelling, bruising, stinging, and pain. A common cause of 
            these reactions is not using a dry needle for injection. Even a small amount of medication dripping 
            out of the tip of the needle can be very irritating to the skin as the rest of the needle passes through. 
            The introduction of autoinjector technologies has made subcutaneous injection easier and has improved 
            patient satisfaction<sup>66</sup>. However, patients should still be instructed on proper injection 
            techniques as well as on strategies to minimise injection-site reactions. Routinely rotating injection 
            sites, allowing medications to come to room temperature, and cooling or warming the injection site 
            before the injection are all techniques used successfully to reduce or prevent injection-site 
            reactions<sup>64,65</sup>. Local anaesthetics may also be used to prevent injection-site pain<sup>67</sup>. 
        </p>
        <h3>3.4.2.2 Managing Pain and Cutaneous Reactions</h3>
        <p>
            Pain, in the form of tenderness to the touch, can occur immediately upon injection and/or appear 24–48 
            hours post-injection. Muscle aches have been reported following injection with IFNβ-1a and 1b. Glatiramer 
            acetate and IFNß sometimes cause a transient stinging sensation that rarely leads to treatment cessation. 
            Glatiramer can cause localised redness, itching or inflammation. Some people have reported hard spots under 
            the skin together with pain, but these are usually mild and diminish with time. A number of interventions 
            are possible for the MS Nurse to manage these side effects. The MS Nurse should advise the person with MS to:
        </p>
        <ol>   
            <li><span>Ensure proper injection technique is being used</span></li>
            <li><span>Ensure that injection sites are rotated and not used again for at least seven days (figure 5)</span></li>
            <li><span>Apply ice before and after injection – but not to inject ice-cold solution, which should be allowed to come to room temperature first</span></li>
            <li><span>Gently massage the injection site to disperse the solution – but not to rub</span></li>
            <li><span>Inject only into healthy tissue, and after a couple of hours to check for redness, tenderness or swelling</span></li>
            <li><span>Use vial adapters where available</span></li>
            <li><span>Avoid exposing the injection site to excessive sunlight or UV light</span></li>
            <li><span>Use paracetamol or ibuprofen if their doctor permits</span></li>
        </ol>

            Injection site necrosis (break-down of skin tissue) is a rare cutaneous reaction, but if ignored 
            it can lead to complications such as infection and tissue loss. If it occurs, the MS Nurse must 
            organise a complete blood count in order to determine whether the white blood cell count is high 
            enough to allow autolysis. Appropriate topical treatments should be initiated based on white blood 
            cell count, stage of the wound and presence or absence of infection, and antibiotics may be needed 
            if infection is present. If these interventions fail and injection site necrosis continues to be 
            a problem it may be necessary to suspend or switch treatment.

            <p>
                What might be the educational needs of a person with MS who is learning to 
                self-inject – administration techniques to adopt, tips to minimise infection, site rotation etc?
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="nursetippopup2" class="nursetippopup">            
            <p>
                Adherence to any MS therapy is an issue that needs to be addressed from the time of diagnosis 
                throughout the disease course.  When people with MS are asked to self-inject, common reactions include 
                fear, avoidance, anxiety, autonomic reactions, and disgust. Some people with MS avoid self-injection by 
                relying on family members to administer the injection. Depending on another person to inject can be a 
                barrier to adherence because it affects the person’s independence and increases the likelihood of missed 
                injections if the designated family member is not available. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I always try and provide written information and/or a DVD containing education about the injection 
                technique, rotation of injection sites, and skin problems which might occur and how to manage them. 
                It is also important to take into consideration that the ability to learn has to do with cognition 
                and information processing.

                        Teaching the person with MS to self-inject is based on individual and unstructured approaches.  
                        It is important to try and choose the right learning style for that individual and to have a caring 
                        relationship with the person with MS. If the person with MS is motivated, interested and has familiar
                        ized him or herself with the material in advance, then this is a good starting point. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If possible, go to the person’s home - this is a safe environment for the person with MS. Also there are 
                        no distractions from other tasks you might have to perform. Also there is no lack of time and restlessness. 
                        Try and have the person’s partner present, as two people hear and see more than just one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Try and be present for at least the first two administrations of the injection. Then ask whether the person 
                        with MS feels comfortable administering the injections alone. Schedule a telephone consultation for that 
                        same week and then 2, 4 and 6 weeks after.

            3.4.2.3 Managing Flu-like Symptoms</h3>
        <p>
            Flu-like symptoms occur in many people, 2–6 hours after injection. Symptoms include myalgia, headache, nausea, 
            chills, fatigue and fever. Symptoms usually resolve within 24 hours, but can sometimes persist for up to three 
            or even six months. It may help to establish a titration schedule when initiating treatment if these symptoms 
            are occurring. Many patients find that if they begin at a low dose and titrate the dose up slowly, they can 
            adjust the side effects, and the flulike symptoms often will go away<sup>51</sup>. The use of analgesics is a 
            possibility that can be discussed with the doctor, and if used, the time at which they are taken can be 
            adjusted so that their full effects are felt at the time of injection. In addition, the time of injection 
            can be adjusted so that side effects occur while asleep. Other measures that can be explored include drug formulation, solution temperature (close to body temperature at the time of administration), adequate hydration and a nutritious diet<sup>68</sup>. Helping the patient to include these measures into their daily routine can help with adherence. If these measures do not seem to be working it may 
            be necessary for the doctor to reduce the dose of DMT for 3–4 weeks before gradually increasing it again as 
            tolerated, or they may advise stronger analgesion starting on prednisone.

        <h3>3.4.3	Barriers to Concordance and Strategies to Overcome them</h3>
        <p>
            A wide range of factors influence a patient's ability to adhere to therapy. Access to, and communication with, 
            healthcare providers are key elements in the promotion of concordance. It is important that the MS Nurse is 
            able to not only assess a patient with MS for ‘clinical’ signs and symptoms, but he or she can also engage 
            with the patient’s psychological needs and issues.  It is only by properly understanding a patient’s individual 
            concerns and barriers that effective strategies can be put in place to ensure concordance with therapy (Table 3)<sup>69</sup>.

            Patients with MS who are receiving DMT may be planning pregnancy. The information available regarding 
            pregnancy with different DMTs varies and the MS Nurse should be aware of up to date recommendations 
            regarding contraception, pregnancy and risks. This information can vary over time as more information 
            becomes available, so it may be necessary to seek additional expert advice, and perhaps check with 
            pharmaceutical companies on a regular (e.g. annual) basis.

            Establishing an open and honest healthcare provider-patient relationship, setting realistic expectations 
            about therapy, and providing ongoing education about MS, injection technique, and adverse event management 
            are responsibilities that both the healthcare provider and patient must embrace. Optimising motivation and 
            therefore concordance in patients with long-standing MS will allow these patients to realise the 
            maximal benefits of DMT.

                Clues to non-adherence include missed appointments and evasiveness on the part of the patient. 
                People with MS should be asked about how they are coping with their treatment regimen in a specific, 
                direct, and non-confrontational manner. Simply asking if he is taking his DMT is not sufficient; 
                rather people with MS should be asked specific questions such as “How many injections have you 
                missed in the previous month?” Or “Have you had to miss many injections in the last month, and 
                what would be the main problems for you when you have?”

                If a patient expresses difficulties with adherence, healthcare providers should make every effort 
                to work with them to determine an acceptable solution. In some cases, the solution may involve seeking 
                assistance from family members and/or friends. In other cases, reminder systems, such as drug diaries 
                or alarms may be needed, especially for people with MS experiencing cognitive impairments. Regardless, 
                several steps should be considered when determining the best way to maintain treatment adherence for an 
                individual patient: set realistic expectations, address injection anxiety, and manage and cope with 
                adverse events.
