        <h2>4.6 Bladder Dysfunction</h2>

        <a id="1" name="1"></a>
        <h3>4.6.1 Background</h3>
        <p>
            Many people with MS have bladder dysfunction<sup>1,149</sup>.  MS lesions lead to detrusor 
            instability and sphincter problems which can produce symptoms of overactive bladder 
            (urinary frequency, incontinence) or urinary retention<sup>1,150</sup>; overactive bladder/destrusor 
            instability is the more common condition, reported in approximately 60% of people 
            with MS<sup>150</sup>.
        </p>
        <a id="2" name="2"></a>
        <h3>4.6.2 Assessment: Role of the MS Nurse</h3>
        <p>
            Patients may be reluctant to report incontinence and other bladder issues as many people 
            can feel a sense of shame and embarrassment. It is important, therefore, that the MS Nurse 
            is prepared to raise this with their patients and that the nurse considers how he/she might 
            handle these discussions with care and discretion.  Simple questions may help patients 
            discuss their symptoms in an open and trusting environment<sup>151</sup>.

        <h3>4.6.3 Management</h3>
        <p>
            Managing bladder and bowel problems requires a comprehensive and holistic approach that sees a 
            step wise escalation of interventions. Although behavioural therapy and bladder training (e.g. 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1"> Kegel exercises </a>
            ) may be helpful in patients with OAB, most will require pharmacologic therapy – the mainstay  
            of therapy being anticholinergic agents such as oxybutinin, tolterodine, solifenacin, trospium, 
            or tricyclic antidepressants<sup>1,152</sup>.  Although there is a lot of evidence for these 
            drugs to treat OAB, there is less information on their use in people with MS<sup>152</sup>.  A 
            systematic review identified only five trials, of which only a study of oxybutinin reported 
            significant effects on frequency<sup>152</sup>.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Anticholinergic therapy is associated with typical side effects including dry mouth, blurred vision 
            and constipation<sup>1</sup>, with some evidence that the newer agents (e.g. tolterodine, fesoterodine, darifenacin, 
            trospium and solifenacin) are less frequently associated with troublesome anticholinergic symptoms and 
            some permit dose adjustment to achieve an acceptable compromise between efficacy and tolerability<sup>151,153</sup>. 
            In addition, the older antimuscarinic agents have been associated with cognitive changes; this is less 
            frequently reported with the newer agents; notably trospium.

            Kegel exercises can help both men and women who have problems with urine leakage or bowel control. 
            The aim of Kegel exercises is to improve <b>muscle tone</b> by strengthening the <b>pubococcygeus muscles</b> of 
            the <b>pelvic floor</b>. Kegel exercises can be done at any time and any place. Most people prefer to do 
            the exercises while lying down or sitting in a chair. After 4 – 6 weeks, most people notice some 
            improvement but it may take as long as 3 months to see clinical benefit. Instructions for Kegel 
            exercises<sup>151</sup>:
            <ul>
                <li><span>Pull in or squeeze your pelvic muscle as if you were trying to stop urine flow</span></li>
                <li><span>Hold for several seconds</span></li>
                <li><span>Relax and repeat</span></li>
                <li><span>Perform at least 3 sets of 10 contractions every day</span></li>
            </ul>            
        </div>

        <p>
            For those not responding to first line therapy, or developing recurrent UTIs referral to a urologist 
            may be necessary<sup>1</sup>.  Treatment strategies that may be considered in patients not responding 
            to anticholinergic therapy may include 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup2"> ‘transcutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation’ 
            (PTNS/TPTNS),  </a>
            which may be used to provide long term control of OAB without the adverse events of anticholinergic 
            therapy by some urologists<sup>154</sup>. In one study of PTNS in 70 people with MS, daily TPTNS 
            sessions over 3 months produced clinical improvement in over 80% of patients<sup>155</sup>.
        </p>
        <div id="deepdivepopup2" class="deepdivepopup">
            Percutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) for overactive bladder involves inserting a fine 
            needle into a nerve just above the ankle. A mild electric current is passed through the needle and 
            carried to the nerves that control bladder function.
        </div>
        <p>
            For patients with refractory OAB, 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup3"> botulinum toxin </a>
            is being increasingly used to provide relief<sup>156</sup>, including those with MS<sup>157-159</sup>.  
            In a study with people with MS, three-quarters reported clinical improvement, including one-half of 
            patients who reported ‘complete success’ (total continence).  Non-response was more likely in those 
            with advanced MS<sup>125</sup>. In this study no complications from therapy were reported, but 
            potential complications include pain, urinary tract infections, and haematuria<sup>158,159</sup>.
        </p>
        <div id="deepdivepopup3" class="deepdivepopup">
            For the treatment of OAB, botulinum toxin is diluted in saline and during cytoscopy injected in small 
            quantities into the detrusor muscle, avoiding the triogene.  Analgesia, e.g. through inhaled anaesthetic 
            such as nitrous oxide is provided and patients must be taught self catheterisation as an increase in 
            post-void volume can occur.
        </div>
        <p>
            Nocturnal incontinence and night-time urinary frequency are two of the worst problems associated with 
            urinary impairment. For most people with MS, symptoms are helped significantly by taking an oral 
            antimuscarinic before going to bed. Sometimes difficulties persist and desmopressin at night may be 
            effective as it reduces the volume of urine produced overnight by the kidneys (when they are at their 
            most productive). Its action lasts for 3-6 hours and it is safe when taken precisely as instructed. 
            Desmopressin is usually taken as a spray. It can be used during the daytime but it is essential that 
            the user realises the possible dangers of retaining too much water if it is used more than once in 24 
            hours. It should not be prescribed to people over 65.
        </p>
        <p>
            Patients suffering from retention may need to learn self-catheterisation and there is some evidence 
            that &#945;-adrenergic antagonists may provide some benefit<sup>1,149</sup>.
