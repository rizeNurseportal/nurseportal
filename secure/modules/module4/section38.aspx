        <h3>3.8.1 Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Natalizumab is a monoclonal <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1">  antibody</a>  
            which inhibits migration of lymphocytes across the blood-brain barrier. Like fingolimod it 
            does not cause lymphocyte depletion and on discontinuation of therapy lymphocyte levels 
            will be restored, and therefore, disease activity will return<sup>97,98</sup>.  
        </p>
        <div id="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdivepopup">
            Antibodies are naturally occurring proteins produced by the immune system in response to 
            foreign substances.  Once produced by the body, they recognize and bind to specific proteins 
            (antigens) on bacteria, viruses, and toxins, to help the body fight disease. Monoclonal 
            antibodies, such as natalizumab, are produced in cell culture systems.  They can be designed 
            to bind to receptors on the body’s normal cells. By recognizing and attaching to these receptors, 
            monoclonal antibodies can interfere with (or alter) normal or abnormal cellular responses.  
            In this way, monoclonal antibodies may be useful in the treatment of certain diseases.
        </div>
        <p>
            The use of natalizumab varies in different countries; however in general it is used for those patients with 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup2">  rapidly evolving RRMS</a> 
            or for those who continue to relapse despite being on DMTs.
        </p>
        <div id="deepdivepopup2" class="deepdivepopup">
            Rapidly evolving RRMS is defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more 
            Gadolinium enhancing lesions on MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared 
            to a previous recent MRI.
        </div>
        <p>
            Natalizumab is given as an IV infusion once every 4 weeks (Table 13). This is followed by a 1-hour 
            observation period for signs of hypersensitivity<sup>35</sup>.

            Table 14: Efficacy of natalizumab in RRMS<sup>98</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to remember that in many countries natalizumab is initiated only after 
            ‘first line’ therapy has failed, or in rapidly evolving RRMS; it is not clear whether 
            natalizumab will show the efficacy observed in the Phase III clinical trials in this 
            more advanced patient population.

        <h3>3.8.3 Adverse Events</h3>
        <p>
            In clinical trials natalizumab was relatively well tolerated; the most common events reported 
            were dizziness, nausea, urticaria and rigors associated with infusions. Up to 4% of patients 
            suffered hypersensitivity reactions, but less than 1% suffered anaphylactic reactions. Symptoms 
            reported included hypotension, hypertension, chest pain, chest discomfort, dyspnoea and angioedema<sup>35</sup>.

            Table 15: Adverse events during natalizumab therapy in RRMS<sup>98</sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            Therapy with natalizumab has been associated with Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML). 
            PML is an opportunistic infection caused by JC virus (John Cunningham virus), which may be fatal or 
            result in severe disability. Such infections are common but remain dormant in people with healthy 
            immune systems. Prior to the introduction of natalizumab, PML was seen primarily in immunocompromised 
            patients such as those with HIV or undergoing immunosuppressant therapy. Symptoms of PML are diverse, 
            progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness 
            of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory and orientation, leading to confusion 
            and personality changes. The progression of deficits can lead to death or severe disability over 
            weeks or months. A recent study found that the combination of three risk factors – prior positivity 
            for JC virus antibody, history of receiving immunosuppressant drugs, and duration of natalizumab 
            therapy - resulted in the highest risk for developing PML in MS patients treated with natalizumab<sup>99</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As of February 29, 2012, there were 212 confirmed cases of PML among 99,571 patients treated with 
            natalizumab (2.1 cases per 1000 patients). Recent data reported in the New England Journal of 
            <i>Medicine</i><sup>99</sup> change these risk levels slightly for patients with positive JC virus 
            antibody, as follows: 
        </p>

        <ul>        
            <li><span>No prior immunosuppressants and exposure 1 to 24 months: 0.56 per 1,000 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.83)</span></li>
            <li><span>No prior immunosuppressants and exposure 25 to 48 months: 4.6 per 1,000 (95% CI 3.7 to 5.6)</span></li>
            <li><span>Prior immunosuppressants and exposure 1 to 24 months: 1.6 per 1,000 (95% CI 0.91 to 2.6)</span></li>
            <li><span>Prior immunosuppressants and exposure 25 to 48 months: 11.1 per 1,000 (95% CI 8.3 to 14.5)</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Immunosuppressants in this context include several agents that have been used off-label to treat 
            severe MS flares, including mitoxantrone, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate mofetil.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is therefore usually advised that people starting natalizumab have the 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup3"> JCV antibody test </a>.
        </p>
        <div id="deepdivepopup3" class="deepdivepopup">
            The JCV antibody test determines whether a person with MS has been exposed to the JC Virus by 
            detecting antibodies; a person that has antibodies to JC virus is at an increased risk of PML.  
            A commercial test for JC virus antibodies was introduced in 2011, and natalizumab's label now 
            suggests that patients be tested before starting on the drug and periodically during treatment 
            to detect new infections. The test is now included as routine screening for people beginning 
            therapy with natalizumab and can significantly reduce risk of PML. The test does not indicate 
            if someone will or will not get PML. The test indicates an individual's relative level of risk, 
            information that can be used to make decisions about ongoing treatment. A positive test will 
            require that the person's health is carefully monitored during treatment with natalizumab.
        </div>

        <p>
            Up to November 2013 there were 418 confirmed cases of PML<sup>100</sup>. Reflective of this data, the risks of PML are 1 in 10 000 if the patient is JCV negative. If the patient is JCV positive, their risks are 1 in 1429 in the first 2 years, 1 in 189 for months 25–48, and 1 in 164 for months 49–72. If the patient is JCV positive and also had previous immunosuppression, their chances of PML are 1 in 556 in the first 2 years and 1 in 89 for the following 25–48 months.
        </p>

        <p>
            Planned interruption of natalizumab therapy might lessen PML risk, but no prospective controlled studies have previously examined the effects of natalizumab treatment interruption. RESTORE was a randomized, partially placebo-controlled exploratory study examining MS disease activity during a 24-week interruption of natalizumab therapy<sup>101</sup>. Despite use of other therapies, MRI and clinical activity of MS recurred during natalizumab interruption in some patients who had been relapse-free for 1 year. Therefore, stopping natalizumab appears to increase the risk of MS relapse or MRI disease activity as compared with continuing natalizumab.

        <h3> 3.8.4 Nursing Considerations</h3>
        <p>
            While natalizumab can be highly effective, there are a number of precautions and the MS Nurse 
            should be prepared to counsel the patient appropriately, and if necessary, organise pre-treatment 
            assessments for JC Virus antibodies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The patient should also be advised of possible adverse events which may occur between infusions, 
            and to report them as appropriate.  In particular, patients taking natalizumab should, together 
            with their caregivers, be instructed on early signs and symptoms of PML (e.g. progressive 
            weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, visual disturbance, changes in 
            thinking, memory and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes, cognitive 
            or psychiatric symptoms)<sup>35</sup>.

            Natalizumab IV every 4 weeks has shown significant activity against RRMS compared with placebo 
            and is generally well tolerated. However, due to concerns regarding PML, it is used for rapidly 
            evolving RRMS or those with active disease on first-line DMTs.
