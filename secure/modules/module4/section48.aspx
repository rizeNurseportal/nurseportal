        <h2>4.8 Sexual Dysfunction</h2>

        <h3>4.8.1 Background</h3>
        <p>
            Normal sexual function involves a complex series of physical and psychological factors that are 
            easily disturbed in a chronic disease such as MS. Sexual problems are not only distressing but 
            can have a large impact on QoL for both patients and their partners<sup>163</sup>. The most prevalent 
            sexual complaint in men with MS is erectile dysfunction (ED), which has been estimated to affect 
            up to 70% of patients<sup>164,165</sup>.

        <h3>4.8.2 Assessment: Role of the MS Nurse</h3>
        <p>
            The MS Nurse can approach sexual health and well-being in a number of ways. A first step may be to 
            normalise the topic with an open question; for example “Many people with MS find they have some 
            problems with sexual function and it is a very common problem - have you experienced any issues”. 
            This can bring an opportunity to begin immediate discussion about the issues of sexual and personal 
            relationships, or allow for the person to come back to you when they feel able.  Information about 
            locally available counselling and support services can also be made available. The individual and 
            any partner(s) should be offered an opportunity to see a specialist in sexual problems for advice 
            on lubricants and the use of sexual aids, and for general information regarding sexual relations<sup>166</sup>.

        <h3>4.8.3 Management</h3>
        <p>
            Treatments for sexual dysfunction in patients with MS of both genders are, in the main, the same as 
            for the general population and largely depend on the aetiology of the problem. Oral phosphodiesterase 
            5 (PDE5) inhibitors can be prescribed for patients with ED and there is evidence to suggest that 
            sildenafil can be effective in both sexes at doses up to 100 mg, although the data in men are more 
            robust<sup>167</sup>. Tadalafil has the advantage of being effective for up to 36 hours which may 
            mean less planning and pressure to have sexual intercourse to a schedule. In an Italian study, 78% 
            of men with MS responded to 10-20mg doses of tadalafil, with statistically significant improvements 
            in erectile function and in sexual satisfaction scores<sup>168</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A variety of topical lubricants, gels and creams are available to overcome vaginal dryness, and androgen 
            therapy with such compounds as methyltestosterone or dehydroepiandrosterone can help to increase libido, 
            particularly in women with low androgen concentrations<sup>169</sup>. However, long-term use of these 
            latter compounds is not advised due to their side effect profile.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pelvic floor muscle training, alone or in combination with intravaginal neuromuscular electrostimulation or transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation, has also been shown to contribute to the improvement of sexual dysfunction in women with MS<sup>170</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most important intervention is to have an open discussion with the patient and their partner, and refer on to appropriate specialist if desired and necessary.
