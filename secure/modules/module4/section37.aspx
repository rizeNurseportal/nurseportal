            3.7.1 Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Fingolimod is an oral DMT (Table 10) which in some countries is approved for first-line 
            use (i.e. as an alternative to IFNβ or glatiramer), while in others it is approved for 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1">  rapidly evolving RRMS </a>
            , and those who continue to suffer highly active disease while receiving IFNβ. These 
            patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course 
            (normally at least one year of treatment) of beta-interferon. Patients should have had at 
            least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense 
            lesions in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gadolinium-enhancing lesion.
        </p>

        <div id="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdivepopup">
            Rapidly evolving RRMS is defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or 
            more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as 
            compared to a previous recent MRI.

        <p>
            As the first oral DMT available in most countries, fingolimod offered a new option for patients who, until then, were required to self-administer their IFN or glatiramer, or to attend out-patients for infusions (e.g. natalizumab).  Although substantially more convenient, an oral therapy requires the same amount of ‘commitment’ from the patient – concordance with their prescribed treatment is equally important and therefore patients must continue to take their DMT ‘seriously’. The MS Nurse should be prepared to emphasise the importance of taking fingolimod every day, and provide help and advice that will encourage the person with MS to take their treatment as prescribed. In a recent US survey, fingolimod was the DMT with the highest neurologist-reported percentage of patients who were “Very/Extremely Satisfied” with treatment (31.0%); adherence was also rated at 94%<sup>30</sup>.

        <p>
            Fingolimod works by reversibly blocking a large proportion of lymphocytes (which are involved in 
            the auto immune attack) from leaving the lymph nodes and subsequently entering the central nervous 
            system<sup>91-93</sup>. On discontinuation of therapy, lymphocyte counts return to normal but 
            benefits of therapy will be lost<sup>34</sup>.

        <h3>3.7.2 Efficacy</h3>

        <p>
            Two large clinical trials have evaluated fingolimod (FREEDOMS and TRANSFORMS).  
        </p>
        <p>
            One trial compared fingolimod with placebo over 2 years (FREEDOMS - Table 11) in patients with RRMS 
            who were largely treatment experienced<sup>94</sup>. This reported a 54% reduction in annual relapse rate compared 
            with placebo, and a 48% reduction in confirmed relapses over the 2 year study; after 2 years 70% of 
            patients receiving fingolimod 0.5 mg were relapse free compared with 46% of placebo-treated patients 
            (Figure 9)<sup>94</sup>. There was also a reduction in MRI activity as measured by the number of new 
            and enlarged T2 lesions (mean 2.5 vs 9.8) and the number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions (mean 0.2 vs 1.1); 
            there was also significantly less loss of brain volume with fingolimod.

            In addition, in a 1-year trial (TRANSFORMS), fingolimod was found to be superior to 
            IFNβ-1a IM weekly in terms of annual relapse rate and MRI-related outcomes<sup>95</sup>.

            Because transient decreases in heart rate were reported in some patients, although rarely at the 
            0.5 mg dose, it is recommended that patients are observed for 6 hours after taking their first 
            dose for signs of bradycardia and admitted if symptoms occur until these resolve<sup>34</sup>. 
            Although the current European SmPC for fingolimod recommends observation for signs and symptoms 
            of bradycardia<sup>34</sup>, in other countries, ECG monitoring is recommended.  Recently a ‘Dear 
            Healthcare Professional’ letter issued by Novartis to European healthcare providers made some 
            recommendations for the 6-hour observation period:-
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span>Baseline and discharge 12-lead ECG should be available</span></li>
            <li><span>Continuous ECG monitoring for the 6 hour first-dose observation</span></li>
            <li><span>At least hourly blood pressure and heart-rate assessments.</span></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Specific recommendations to continue extended assessment are also made in patients with signs 
            and symptoms suggestive of bradycardia or changes on ECG. Some centres may have adapted these 
            recommendations to develop internal protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
            Patients receiving fingolimod should also be warned to report any signs of symptoms of 
            bradycardia (e.g. dizziness, shortness of breath) immediately to their MS Nurse or doctor.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup2"> Macular oedema</a> has also been reported in a small number 
            of patients (0.4% with 0.5 mg in the clinical development programme).  As a result patients require 
            an eye examination 3 – 4 months after commencing therapy, or if any visual disturbances occur during 
            therapy<sup>34</sup>. Patients with diabetes or a history of uveitis also require a pre-treatment 
            eye examination. If macular oedema is suspected, treatment should be discontinued. Macular oedema 
            will generally resolve once fingolimod is stopped.  It is however, important to arrange prompt referral 
            if there is uncertainty whether an individual patient’s symptoms are suggestive of macular oedema or 
            MS-related optic neuritis.
        </p>
        <div id="deepdivepopup2" class="deepdivepopup">
            Macular oedema is a painless condition characterised by swelling or thickening in the central retina. 
            It is usually, although not always, associated with blurred or distorted vision.

        <p>
            Other tests which may be required before or during fingolimod therapy include a negative pregnancy 
            test pre-screen, liver function tests, varicella zoster status, blood cell counts and blood pressure.  
            In addition, patients may be at increased risk of respiratory infections and patients should be 
            warned to report any symptoms of infection to their doctor or MS centre<sup>34</sup>.Due to a lethal VZV infection during the pivotal trials, it is recommended to perform a VZV vaccination before treatment onset in case of a negative VZV-antibody test. The tests 
            required with fingolimod therapy are summarised in Figure 12.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vaccinations may be less effective during and up to 2 months after treatment with fingolimod. The use 
            of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during this time. MS Nurses need to discuss this with 
            patients and help them plan their lifestyle to avoid the need for vaccines during this 2 month period.

            3.7.4 Nursing Considerations</h3>
        <p>
            As summarised, there are a number of assessments required before fingolimod is taken, when 
            the first dose is taken, and during routine follow up.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, patients will perceive that taking an oral medication is easier and more 
            straightforward, and of course does not require them to inject. However, although fingolimod 
            is an oral therapy, like other DMTs it can be associated with adverse events, and requires 
            follow-up and monitoring, and a level of commitment from the patient to be concordant/adherent.  
            The MS Nurse plays an important role in communicating both the benefits of an oral therapy 
            (in terms of convenience), but also in explaining to the patient possible adverse events to 
            be aware of and signs and symptoms which should be reported immediately to their MS Nurse, 
            doctor, or both. The MS Nurse is likely to be involved in monitoring treatment initiation, providing support in the case of adverse events and promoting patient adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen.

        <div class="keypoint">
            Fingolimod is an oral DMT tested in people with RRMS.  It is superior to placebo over 2 years 
            and, in a 1-year trial, was found to be superior to IFNβ-1a IM weekly. There are specific 
            requirements for pre- and on-treatment assessments including a 6-hour first dose observation.
