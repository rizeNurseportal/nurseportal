                In this module, the pharmacologic management of multiple sclerosis (MS) will be reviewed. The 
                disease modifying therapies (DMTs) will be explored, together with the nursing issues associated 
                with them.  In addition, symptom management strategies will be discussed with an emphasis on pharmacological management.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although disease-modifying therapies (DMT) are increasingly used to reduce the frequency of relapses and delay the 
                progression of disability, most people with MS will experience neurological symptoms <sup>1</sup>. 
                Others will experience relapses during therapy which may give rise to new symptoms<sup>1</sup>.  It has been 
                suggested that DMTs represent a 'longer-term' treatment, or investment in the future, and therefore 
                DMT should be combined with active symptom management<sup>1-3</sup>.
            </p>
            <p>As new research and emerging therapies change the treatment paradigm for MS, the nursing role and its associated demands are changing as well. Nurses specialising in the care of MS patients need to stay abreast of MS research and disease-modifying agents available, because patients are eager to make use of these new treatments. Nurses also need to be aware of the complex and sometimes novel drug treatments, which can have complicated side effects, if they are to successfully and proactively support people with MS. The criteria for use of these treatments differ by country.</p>

            <p>
                Following completion of this module you will be able to understand the options for DMT for people with 
                MS, the efficacy and adverse events most commonly reported and how DMTs are typically utilised in 
                different patient types.  In addition, drug therapy for the more common symptoms experienced by people 
                with MS is reviewed and summarised.
