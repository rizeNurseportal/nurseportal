        <h2>2.4 Relapse</h2>

        <a id="1" name="1"></a>
        <h3>2.4.1 Introduction / Background</h3>
        <p>According to the 2010 revisions to the McDonald Criteria of the International Panel on Diagnosis of MS, a relapse is defined as “a patient-reported or objectively observed event typical of an acute inflammatory demyelinating event in the CNS, current or historical, with duration of at least 24 hours, in the absence of fever or infection.” </p>
        <p> 
            A relapse typically develops over hours or days but will eventually plateau, which may last days or weeks, followed by complete or incomplete recovery at varying rates. The majority of relapses are monofocal (research states ~74%), but they can also be multifocal, and are mainly sensory (48%),  pyramidal (34.4%) and visual (20%)<sup>4</sup>.  
        </p>
        <p>Either way, a stable or improving period of 30 days should separate the onset of subsequent events for them to be distinguished as separate relapses<sup>5</sup>. </p>

        <p>
            It is known that acute viral infections, such as influenza or a urinary tract infection (UTI), and possibly other stressors, including hormonal cycle in women, can affect neurological function and can be confused with a clinical relapse<sup>6,7</sup> .
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to distinguish between a true ‘relapse’ and a pseudorelapse, which is a relapse typically associated with an increase in heat whether this is from an infection, exercise or, occasionally, fatigue. (<a href="../module3/section31.aspx" target="_blank"> link to section 3 on diagnosis</a> and <a href="../module2/section21.aspx" target="_blank"> 2 on presentation</a>)  Within the assessment of a relapse, nurses are likely to perform urinalysis and a recording of vital signs prior to any steroid prescription<sup>8</sup>. Some nurses will also take bloods for inflammatory markers. This assessment is likely to isolate any infection the individual is carrying that they may not know about. Some will check blood glucose to monitor for hyperglycaemia. 
        </p>
        <p>Comparing serial MRI scans may identify new plaques in the CNS but these additional lesions may be clinically silent; a causal relationship can not necessarily be assumed. Distinguishing between an exacerbation and functional neurologic symptoms requires careful history taking and examination by an experienced neurologist.

        <h3>2.4.2 Impact of a relapse on the patient</h3>
        <p>
            Relapses can have a significant impact, not only on the experience of physical symptoms, but also on the social, financial and psychological well-being of those affected. Whilst in relapse, many cannot drive; there can be loss of income and significant difficulties bringing up a young family, especially for single parents.  There is a high level of anxiety and uncertainty associated with the unpredictable occurrence and possible long term effects of relapses<sup>9</sup>. These impacts must also be taken into account when planning relapse management to contribute to a more optimal patient centred approach<sup>10</sup>. 
        </p>


         <a id="3" name="3"></a>
        <h3>2.4.3 Impact of DMTs on Relapses</h3>
        <p>
            The annual relapse rate (ARR) historically was approximately.1.5/year but it is dropping. It is a recognized feature that relapse frequency decreases with time from diagnosis and also with increasing age, and relapse-free periods are not uncommon<sup>11</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            On average, a patient with RRMS may experience a clinically presented relapse every two years; DMT therapy can reduce the chances of a relapse in one year by approximately one-third (see section 3 Preventing relapse & disease progression: DMTs), and early initiation of DMT has been shown to delay progression from Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) to clinically definite MS.  Continuous DMT therapy has also been shown to delay progression to SPMS.
        </p>
        <div class="keypoint">
            Early initiation of DMT (with either interferon beta or glatiramer acetate) has been shown to delay 
            progression from Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) to clinically definite MS.

        <h3>2.4.4 Aims of Management of a Relapse</h3>
        <p>
            Even with DMT, relapse can occur,  ranging from extremely mild to significantly disabling, at times requiring hospitalisation and supportive care<sup>12</sup>. Some relapses are clinically silent and may only be detected by MRI at time of inflammation so people with MS can accrue early loss of brain tissue without obvious signs of damage.
        </p>
        <p>
            The aim of treatment, when initiated, is to reduce inflammation in the short term and to thereby hasten recovery.  Many episodes will improve spontaneously regardless of therapy (usually steroid therapy – see section 2.4.5).  It is important that the benefits of steroids are weighed up against the adverse effects of treatment; on average, physicians treat 25% of relapses<sup>13</sup>.

        <h3>2.4.5 Treatment of a Relapse</h3>
        
        <p>
            <b>Steroid therapy: Principles and efficacy</b> <br />
            High-dose, short-term steroids is the accepted treatment for MS relapses. Steroid therapy is effective in shortening the duration of an individual’s relapse and accelerating recovery<sup>14,15</sup>.
        </p>
        <div class="keypoint">
            Steroid therapy is effective in shortening the duration of an individual’s relapse and accelerating recovery.   
        </div>
        <p>
            Steroid preparations have been used to treat MS relapse events for over 50 years; the most commonly used 
            are methylprednisolone and prednisones<sup>14</sup>. There is, however, no evidence that steroid therapy has any effect 
            on the course of disease and it is important that the person with MS understands that recovery from an acute 
            relapse will be the same whether he/she receives steroids or not.

        </div>
       <%-- <p>
            The usual treatment for relapses is methylprednisolone. This is a long-acting, synthetic corticosteroid 
            which is considered more effective than the natural substance cortisol. Both oral and intravenous (IV) 
            steroids are used to treat acute relapses and while there is good evidence for both, few studies have 
            compared IV and oral therapy<sup>8</sup>. From the available evidence, IV and oral steroid therapy appear to be 
            equally effective, and the selection of both steroid and route of administration varies between MS 
            centres<sup>8,9</sup>.   
        </p>--%>
       
        <p>There is considerable diversity amongst neurologists and in national guidelines regarding dose, duration and choice of steroid agent. Guidelines in the UK recommend oral treatment with 500mg methylprednisolone for 5 days; if patients are in hospital, or if oral steroids are not effective, intravenous treatment with 1g methylprednisolone for 3-5 days is recommended<sup>16</sup>. Oral treatment is now known to be as effective as the intravenous route<sup>14</sup>.</p>
        <p>
            Commonly used regimens are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Intravenous methylprednisolone, 500–1000 mg daily, for between 3 and 5 days, or </span></li>
            <li><span>High-dose oral methylprednisolone, 500–2000 mg daily, for between 3 and 5 days <sup>9</sup>.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The decision to treat is best taken in conjunction with the patient in a process of shared decision-making (SDM) and is based on adequate information provision and an assessment of the impact of the relapse on the individual. In a randomized controlled trial, patients educated about the evidence regarding steroid use during relapse decided to treat less relapses, opted for more oral than intravenous steroids, had higher levels of perceived autonomy and sought less contact with their clinicians<sup>17</sup>.
        </p>
         <p>
            Steroids may sometimes not be administered if a patient has an optic neuritis; although the immunological characteristics of MS patients with optic neuritis is similar to those with other forms of relapse<sup>18</sup>, effects of high dose methylprednisolone have been inconclusive; with some suggestion of improved symptoms on visual analogue scale, but not visual acuity<sup>19</sup>.  The Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial was a 15 centre study undertaken in the US to compare prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day oral for 14 days), methylprednisolone (250 mg IV every 6 hours for 3 days) and placebo. The trial found that high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone accelerated visual recovery but did not improve the 6-month or 1-year visual outcome compared with placebo, whereas treatment with oral prednisone alone did not improve the outcome and was associated with an increased rate of recurrences of optic neuritis. Most patients had complete, or near complete recovery 1 year after their attack<sup>20,21</sup>. 
        </p>

     

        <div class="keypoint">
            The usual therapy for relapses is high-dose IV or oral steroids. The selection of steroid 
            (usually methylprednisolone) and route varies between MS centres.
        </div>
        <%--<p>
            A study is currently comparing oral methylprednisolone (1400 mg daily for 5 days) and IV 
            methylprednisolone (1000 mg/day for 5 days)<sup>14</sup>.  
        </p>--%>
        <p>
            There is no substantial evidence regarding the optimum time to administer steroids when a patient is suffering 
            a relapse.  However, often they are given relatively early during a relapse episode. Sometimes the dose may 
            be tapered (reduced) over a few days.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some patients will find their relapse is so disabling it requires hospitalisation and supportive care<sup>12</sup>; 
            others can be treated at home or as an out-patient.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is some evidence to show that recovery from a relapse is improved by having rehabilitation as well as 
            steroids<sup>22</sup>. Rehabilitation can combine many different approaches to managing MS including 
            physiotherapy, occupational therapy, dietary advice, and employment services. Relapses may also prompt a change in therapy, 
            for example a switch of DMT.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Side effects of steroid therapy</b><br />
            Not all patients experience side effects when they receive steroid therapy for a relapse. However, 
            in one study of 55 patients who had received high dose steroids, 53% experienced adverse events<sup>23</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adverse events from steroid therapy include:
        </p>
        <ul>            
            <li><span>Effects on the gastrointestinal tract and bloating</span></li>
            <li><span>Change in sleep patterns/insomnia</span></li>
            <li><span>Altered mood/; fear, mania and depression</span></li>
            <li><span>General malaise</span></li>
            <li><span>A metallic taste in the mouth (particularly after IV administration)</span></li>
            <li><span>Confusion</span></li>
            <li><span>Fluid retention</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Other, less common events include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels)</span></li>
            <li><span>Acne</span></li>
            <li><span>Transient reddening of the face</span></li>
            <li><span>Urogenital infections</span></li>
            <li><span>Increased blood pressure</span></li>
            <li><span>Oedema in the ankles and weight gain</span></li>
            <li><span>Infections</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Long-term effects on bone density can occur, but this is less of a concern with short course therapy<sup>24</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>For some patients with MS (for example, those who have type 1 diabetes, a chronic infection such as TB, severe hypertension, history of psychosis/mania), high dose steroids are contraindicated. In these cases, alternative management of relapse is indicated.</p>

        <p>Even though corticosteroid therapy is often used to treat relapse, relatively little data exist on how patients perceive the efficacy and overall value of this approach. Results of a new survey of 4,500 MS patients found that patients who receive treatment for relapses report better outcomes than those who are simply observed. However, 34% of patients feel that their symptoms following corticosteroid treatment are worse than pre-relapse symptoms and that treatment had no effect or worsened symptoms<sup>25</sup>.</p>

        <h4 class="Plasmapheresis">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plasmapheresis :</h4>
        <p>Other treatment options that are used less frequently include plasmapheresis. Plasmapheresis, also known as therapeutic plasma exchange, is a procedure that involves separating the blood, exchanging the plasma (typically with donor plasma or albumin solution), and returning the other components, primarily red blood cells, to the patient. It is typically reserved for those patients who experience an incomplete recovery with other treatments. Recently updated guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology suggest that plasmapheresis is probably effective as adjunctive therapy and possibly effective for exacerbations that fail to respond to high-dose corticosteroids<sup>26</sup>.</p>

        <h3>
            2.4.6 The Role of the MS Nurse</h3>

        <p>Only if relapses are accurately reported, recorded and assessed can patients be assured of receiving the correct treatment for their individual pattern of disease. MS Nurses are becoming increasingly active in relapse care and the UK has witnessed an evolvement of a MS nurse led relapse service; this has been accelerated since oral steroids (which can be prescribed by non medical prescribers such as MS Nurses) have been regarded as having similar efficacy as IV methylprednisolone and purport high compliance amongst patients<sup>27</sup>. However, primary research that supports or refutes the MS Nurse role in relapse management is lacking.  </p>

        <p>Part of the role of the MS Nurse involves the correct identification of relapse, the right assessment, and the application of the appropriate intervention<sup>28</sup>. To do this most effectively, there is a need for MS nurses to be clear regarding a definition of a relapse; this focuses not only on objectively observed events, but also that it is a ’patient reported event’. If the patient says the relapse is disabling and articulates how this is so, then the nurses will use this to form a management plan.   </p>

        <p>It is essential that MS Nurses can effectively communicate with the patient in order to build a reliable clinical history of their relapse experience;<sup>29</sup> this is particularly important when the patient is experiencing cognitive dysfunction or depression, as the MS Nurse will need to spend considerable time plotting the symptom history and keeping the patient focused on the assessment that is required. With lack of research to guide nursing practice, there has been a reliance on expert consensus groups to decide on key practical aspects of relapse management, such as the work by Perrin Ross et al (2012) who have designed the “Assessing Relapse in Multiple Sclerosis (ARMS) Questionnaire” which is growing in recognition<sup>10</sup>.</p>
        <p>
            A key nursing role in relapse management is to educate patients about the possible adverse effects of 
            steroid therapy. The MS Nurse should also be prepared to manage adverse events should they occur. The 
            MS Nurse plays an important role in educating why steroids might <b><i>not</i></b> be used, even if the patient 
            thinks they are experiencing a relapse. They also need to inform the patient that whether they receive 
            steroids or not, their outcome will be the same. They should also be mindful of the psychological impact 
            of a “revolving door” of grieving, loss and anxiety, and the socio-economic burden of relapse.
