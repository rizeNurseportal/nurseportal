            4.4.1 Background</h3>
        <p>
            Up to three-quarters of people with MS experience spasticity, the muscle affected
            depending on the location of MS lesions<sup>1</sup>. Spasticity is associated with
            a number of additional symptoms including pain, bowel and bladder function, and
            significantly compromises the ability of individuals to continue with activities
            of daily living<sup>1,133</sup>. Spasticity can compensate for muscle weakness in
            people with MS and therefore treatment can ‘unmask’ weakness<sup>1</sup>.
        </p>
        <a id="2" name="2"></a>
        <h3>
            4.4.2 Management</h3>
        <p>
            For individual patients affected by spasticity, physiotherapy and carefully planned
            exercise can be helpful. Exercise should be carefully planned in collaboration with
            rehabilitation services and include flexibility exercise, aerobic exercise and relaxation<sup>1,134</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            First-line drug therapy is usually baclofen or tizanidine<sup>1,2</sup> <a href="#"

        <p>
            Oral baclofen and tizanidine have similar effects on spasticity<sup>1</sup>. In
            a systematic review<sup>137</sup> the data for baclofen were described as limited,
            however improvements in spasticity were reported in at least some studies<sup>137</sup>.
            There was also evidence that baclofen improves range of motion and frequency of
            spasms and potentially, gait. However, there is no evidence that baclofen improves
            functional ability. Although the evidence for tizanidine was described as more complete,
            the efficacy was described as similar, with improvements demonstrated in the pendulum
            test and spasticity score, as well as tone, in some studies. Again, like baclofen,
            no effect on functional ability was detected<sup>137</sup>. In an analysis of comparative
            studies no difference between tizanidine and baclofen could be observed<sup>137</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            For non-ambulatory patients not responding to baclofen or tizanidine, dantrolene
            may have effects on spasticity; however the data are limited<sup>1,137</sup>. The
            frequent adverse events (weakness and GI symptoms) limit the role of dantrolene<sup>137</sup>,
            and the risk of liver function abnormalities means patients require frequent monitoring
            of liver function<sup>1</sup>. Diazepam may also be used for spasticity, which while
            as effective as baclofen and tizanidine is also more often associated with adverse
            events including sedation and weakness<sup>137</sup>. Patients who are prescribed
            diazepam should be warned of the sedative effects and advised to take their medication
            in the evening before bed<sup>1</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nabiximol is a cannabis extract which works on the cannabinoid receptors in the
            brain and spinal cord. It is licensed in MS as an add-on therapy for those people
            whose spasticity and spasm has not responded to the other available drugs<sup>138,139</sup>.
            It is available as an oral spray. Side effects can include dizziness, sleepiness
            and feelings of light headedness. Occasionally the spray can cause soreness in the
            mouth so it is important to change the spray site regularly. About half of people
            with MS will respond to nabiximol; whether someone is a responder can be identified
            after a four week trial of the drug. The dose can then be controlled by varying
            the number of sprays taken each day.
        </p>
        <p>
            Combination therapy may be helpful to minimise the doses of each agent used, and
            therefore the potential severity of adverse events<sup>1</sup>. Patients may however
            require help to plan their medication as the drugs used are administered with different
            schedules.
        </p>
        <p>
            Patients who lose response to oral medication, or who cannot tolerate therapy may
            gain relief from intrathecal baclofen. The baclofen pump is a surgically implanted
            programmable pump and catheter that delivers the baclofen directly into the intrathecal
            space where fluid flows around the spinal cord. Most people report that the programmable
            pump is not uncomfortable or restrictive, and does not interfere with their movement.
            After a test injection a pump can be used to provide ongoing administration<sup>1</sup>.
            Intrathecal baclofen has been shown to improve rigidity and spasms, particularly
            bilateral leg spasticity<sup>1,134</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Abrupt discontinuation of intrathecal baclofen has resulted in withdrawal symptoms
            that include high fever, altered mental status, exaggerated rebound spasticity,
            and muscle rigidity, that in rare cases has advanced to rhabdomyolysis, multiple
            organ-system failure and death. Patients and caregivers should be advised of the
            importance of keeping scheduled refill visits and should be educated on the early
            symptoms of baclofen withdrawal. Special attention should be given to patients at
            apparent risk (e.g. spinal cord injuries at T-6 or above, communication difficulties,
            history of withdrawal symptoms from oral or intrathecal baclofen).
        </p>
        <p>
            Botulinum toxin has been used off-label for the management of spasticity in people
            with MS for many years, based on the results of studies in patients after stroke
            which demonstrated efficacy<sup>2</sup>. In some markets certain formulations may
            be approved for spasticity, or even specifically MS-related spasticity<sup>2</sup>.
            Treatment with botulinum toxin is generally considered salvage therapy after first-line
            therapy has failed. Adverse events reported include difficulty in swallowing, speaking
            or breathing and fatigue and weakness – the latter being a particular concern in
            people with MS<sup>2</sup>.
