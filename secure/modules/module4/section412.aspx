        <h2>4.12 Role of Complementary & Alternative Medicine</h2>
        <p>
            Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) refers to those forms of treatment which are 
            not widely in use by orthodox healthcare professionals. Complementary refers to those 
            treatments that are used in conjunction with orthodox medicine. Alternative refers to 
            those treatments that are used instead of more conventional approaches.

        <p>
            Between one-third and two-thirds of people with MS will use complementary and alternative 
            medicines, for many reasons and often as an adjunct to conventional therapy<sup>186</sup>. 
            Many of those who use complementary and alternative medicines claim to derive benefit from 
            these therapies including diet, omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants<sup>186</sup>. Patients report most CAM use during the transition from moderate to severe impairment e.g. a reduction of the maximal walking distance. At this stage, patients may try every possible treatment for the disease or its symptoms, whereas patients in an advanced stage of disease may have resigned to the fact that they suffer from an incurable disease<sup>187</sup>.  
        </p>

        <p>
            A recent study found that most prevalent use of CAM was vitamins/minerals (89%, n = 24), nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products (NP) (44%, n = 12), relaxation techniques (33%, n = 9), and special diets (30%, n = 8)<sup>188</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are few trials of these agents; however some have been shown to interact with conventional 
            therapy (for example, St John’s Wort taken with orthodox SSRI can cause serotonin shock syndrome) 
            (Table 30)<sup>186</sup>. Patients should be given evidenced-based information on CAMS so that 
            they can make informed choices and be advised to report use of complementary therapies to their 
            MS Nurse or clinician, to ensure safety and prevent potentially dangerous interaction.
        </p>

            Between one-third and two-thirds of people with MS will use complementary and alternative medicines; 
            individuals should be encouraged to report use to their MS Nurse or clinician.

            An evidence-based guideline regarding the use of CAM in MS has recently been published by the American Academy of Neurology<sup>190</sup>. The guideline focuses on several issues including if CAM therapies reduce specific symptoms and prevent relapses or disability; if CAM use worsen MS or cause serious adverse effects; and if CAM use interfere with MS disease-modifying therapies. Some of the recommendations include oral cannabis extract for spasticity symptoms and pain (excluding central neuropathic pain) (Level A).
