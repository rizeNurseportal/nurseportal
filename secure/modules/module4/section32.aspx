        <h2>3.2 Types of DMT: Immunosuppressants and Immunomodulators</h2>
        <p>
            As described in Module 1: Understanding MS, MS is a complex disease. However, disease modifying 
            therapy (DMT) is now the cornerstone of management for people with RRMS, with the vast majority of patients receiving a DMT. Subcutaneous interferon β-1a and glatiramer acetate are the most commonly prescribed DMTs. In order of importance, the characteristics most affecting selection of specific DMTs are reported by neurologists to be efficacy, safety, tolerability, patient preference, and convenience<sup>30</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The increasing availability of DMTs has had two major effects. Firstly, there is a renewed importance of relapse occurrence, both before and after starting first-line therapy because of the possibility of treatment escalation. Secondly, a zero-tolerance approach to relapses has become possible, leading to the concept of “No Evidence of Disease Activity” (NEDA) which is defined by no evidence of relapse occurrence, sustained disability progression, or new lesion appearance on MRI. Neurologists are divided on their opinion regarding NEDA, and therefore the degree of tolerance to ongoing inflammatory activity varies between countries. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Although most people with MS will require treatment of existing or emergent symptoms (see section 
            Symptom Management), DMT therapy is used to reduce MS relapse rates and cumulative disability. In 
            addition DMT therapy can be helpful in some patients with SPMS (e.g IFNβ-1b).
        </p>
        <div class="keypoint">
            DMT therapy is used to reduce MS relapse rates slow/delay and cumulative disability.
        </div>

        <p>
            Evidence now available indicates that early intervention, for example with interferon beta or glatiramer 
            in patients with CIS, can delay the onset of clinically definite MS<sup>31,32</sup>.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The established therapies are administered parenterally which the patient may self-administer (e.g. interferon beta, glatiramer acetate), or may be given by a healthcare provider (e.g. natalizumab). However newer therapies, notably fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate are oral.
        </p>
        <p>
            Early DMTs included immunosuppressants which reduce the activity of the immune system, thereby 
            reducing the autoimmune mediated effects underlying the pathogenesis of MS.  However, such therapy 
            also reduces the ability of the immune system to react to foreign antigens. This can lead to an 
            increased risk of infections and, potentially, some malignancies<sup>33</sup>.
        </p>

            autoimmune mediated effects underlying the pathogenesis of MS.  
        </div>

        <p>
            Although some immunosuppressant therapy continues to be evaluated for MS, and mitoxantrone (section 3.9) has 
            immune suppressive effects, there has been a focus on immunomodulators as DMTs.  Immunomodulators act by 
            suppressing specific stages of the auto-immune response, and ideally, allow the immune system to function 
            against foreign antigens.

        </div>

        <p>
            Currently approved disease modifying therapies include  interferon beta, peginterferon beta-1a, glatiramer acetate, and natalizumab, as well as the newer therapies fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate and alemtuzumab.

        <p>
            Another important concept is that of reversibility of the DMT effect.  Many immunomodulators only have activity 
            while the drug is present in the body; this means that once the DMT is stopped, and 
            levels fall below that which has any activity, the effects on the immune system are lost. In contrast, therapy 
            which has an irreversible effect (for example, immunosuppressive therapy which inhibits synthesis of lymphocytes) 
            requires not only drug concentrations to fall below therapeutic levels, but also for the immune system to be 
            restored (in the example, through production of new lymphocytes) (Figure 1).

        <p>
            For those DMTs which are irreversible it is not only necessary to wait for drug levels to be 
            ‘sub-therapeutic’, but also for natural reconstitution of the immune system (e.g. production of 
            new immune cells).  For reversible DMTs, effects are lost once the drug is ‘washed out’ (Figure 1).  
            Table 1 summarises the recommendations when switching to, or from, currently approved DMTs 
            (based on EMEA labelling); additional information and advice may be available from the relevant 
            pharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, individual centres may have their own treatment protocols. 
            This can have implications for the recommendations made when patients switch DMTs.

            Patients with active MS who switch to fingolimod or natalizumab from other DMTs are likely to experience similar reductions in their use of healthcare resources. Of patients who switched to fingolimod, 68% were free of relapses. That was compared with 69% of patients who switched to natalizumab. The cohorts also recorded similar rates of hospitalizations and corticosteroid use, down significantly from the year before the switch (p < 0.01)<sup>36</sup>.
