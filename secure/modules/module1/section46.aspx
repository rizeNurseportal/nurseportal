			4.6 Positive Symptoms and MS</h2>
		<p>
			People with MS can experience a wide range of positive phenomena and recordings
			in experimentally demyelinated axons suggest that this is due to ectopic activity
			in hyperexcitable demyelinated axons. This is manifested clinically as tingling
			in the trunk and limbs. Some patients also report the presence of sensations provoked
			by body movements which distort areas of the nervous system containing demyelinated
			axons. For instance, patients with cervical posterior column lesions can experience
			an ‘electric shock’ sensation when they turn their head and, similarly, patients
			with demyelinating lesions in the optic nerve can experience flashes of light on
			eye movement.

		<p>
			Pain is a common complaint in MS patients and it appears to have several origins.
			It seems that painful sensations will result from ectopic impulses generated in
			pain fibres. There is evidence to suggest that some positive phenomena can be triggered
			by propagation of the normal impulse traffic through the site of demyelination.
