                It is important for MS Nurses to have an appreciation of the pathophysiology contributing
                to the development of MS. This will provide the essential concepts and information
                required to answer patients’ questions about what causes their disease and how the
                disease will affect their future life. This education and counselling will help
                patients, their family and carers to develop a realistic picture of disease progression,
                assess the benefits of treatment and set appropriate expectations related to its
                management.

                The pathophysiology also helps to explain the multiple symptoms that people with
                MS typically experience, and it underpins the identification of therapeutic targets
                and the optimisation of current and emerging therapies. In addition, an understanding
                of the pathophysiology of MS may help to anticipate the way a person with MS will
                respond to treatment. It will also provide a valuable insight into identifying and
                managing possible side effects that might arise from therapies.
