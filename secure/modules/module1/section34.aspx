            The nervous system is divided into essentially two components:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span>the central nervous system (CNS)</span></li>
            <li><span>the peripheral nervous system (PNS): which consists of nerves outside the
                brain and spinal cord.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The <b>CNS</b> consists of the brain and the spinal cord, plus the optic nerve.
            It is the body’s primary command and coordination system, receiving and processing
            incoming data and instructing responses. The brain comprises of four main regions:
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>cerebral hemispheres</b> which are responsible for higher functions of the
            brain i.e., speech, memory, logic, emotions, consciousness, interpretation and processing
            of sensation and voluntary movement. The cell bodies of neurons which are involved
            in these higher functions are located in the outermost non-myelinated, grey matter
            of the brain, called the <b>cerebral cortex</b>. This consists of several hundreds
            of billions of neurons and is where information processing takes place. The myelinated
            white matter comprises of densely packed bundles of nerve fibres carrying electrical
            impulses to the cortex. The white matter provides the communication between different
            areas of grey matter and between the grey matter and the rest of the body (see Figures
            5 and 6).

            Figure 8). From the cell there are arm-like processes or fibres that can be as long
            as one metre in length. There fibres are of two types:

            Information is conveyed along a neuron by electrical signals (see Figure 9). These
            signals involve a series of events (primarily the movement of ions, particularly
            sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) which cause the electrical charge inside the cell
            to move from its positive depolarised state back to its negative resting state again.
            The resultant waves of electrical activity are known as action potentials.

            Arrival of the nerve impulse at the termination of an axon stimulates the release
            of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft between the two neurons. The neurotransmitters
            then diffuse across the synaptic cleft, bind to the receptors, and stimulate the
            dendrites of the second neuron. Hence a nerve signal is propagated by both electrical
            and chemical means, within and between cells.

            Axons are insulated by myelin sheaths like the plastic coating that surrounds a
            metal core in an electrical cable. It prevents dissipation of the electrical signal
            along the length of the axon. These sheaths are formed by cells exclusive to the
            CNS called the oligodendrocytes which coil round multiple axons – up to 60 different
            axons at a time. The myelin sheaths are interrupted by a series of gaps along each
            axon called the Nodes of Ranvier, where myelin is absent. The Nodes of Ranvier are
            the means by which electrical nerve impulses are rapidly conducted through an axon
            – they allow action potentials to jump from node to node at an accelerated rate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Myelin is a glycoprotein (a protein that has carbohydrate molecules attached), and
            as such is recognised by components of the immune system. In MS, myelin is attacked
            by the patient’s own immune system and compromised, resulting in hardened plaques
            called scleroses. The myelin sheath is thus damaged and electrical signalling is
            short-circuited. Initially, the myelin sheath is repaired (accounting for remission
            in early stages of some types of MS), but eventually the myelin sheath breaks down
            and axons themselves come under attack and are severed. This is associated with
            increasing disability.

            <b>Astrocytes</b>

                The cells provide bracing and anchorage between neurons and blood capillaries. They
                also play a role in making exchanges between the neurons and capillaries and are
                a buffer that protects the delicate neuron from toxic substances in the blood
            </p>
            <b>Microglia</b>
            <p>
                These cells play a phagocytic (cell-engulfing) role and are immunocompetent. They
                are implicated in the progression of several demyelinating diseases including MS.
            </p>

            The brain and the nervous system are protected from potentially toxic chemicals
            (including some drugs) and organisms by the blood–brain barrier. This is composed
            of the least permeable capillaries found in the body, lined with endothelial cells
            that are more tightly packed together than in the rest of the body, forming tight
            junctions. In addition, on the CNS side of the barrier, the endothelial cells are
            covered by a thin basement membrane of cells called pericytes and the ‘feet’ of
            the astrocytes (see Figure 10).

            Only water, glucose, essential amino acids, lipids and lipid-soluble molecules can
            pass through the membranes of these capillaries; thus, hormones do not normally
            cross this barrier but lipid soluble compounds such as alcohol, anaesthetics and
            certain drugs can cross the blood–brain barrier.

            3.4.1 Structure of the Spinal Cord</h3>
        <p>
            The spinal cord is the long extension of the brain stem that provides two-way communication
            between the body and the brain. In humans, there are 31 pairs of spinal nerves which
            enter the spinal cord by penetrating the vertebral column from the surrounding body.
        </p>
        <p>
            The spinal cord comprises grey and white matter. Grey matter surrounds the central
            canal of the cord, which is filled with cerebrospinal fluid, and is shaped into
            horns - dorsal and ventral. Nerves enter the spinal cords by dorsal and ventral
            root ganglia, while motor neurons enter via the ventral root ganglion. White matter
            is located in posterior, lateral and anterior columns, surrounding the horns of
            grey matter (see Figure 11).

        <div class="icon_summary">
            <p>
                The nervous system is divided onto components – the central nervous system (CNS)
                and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Together they relay both physical and cognitive
                information about macro and microenvironments in and around the body, using electrical
                impulses as the signally device.
            </p>
            <p>
                The sheath that surrounds an axon fibre is made of myelin and this is vital for
                the generation and propagation of electrical signals along the axon fibre. In MS,
                this myelin sheath is attacked by a person’s own immune system and destroyed.
