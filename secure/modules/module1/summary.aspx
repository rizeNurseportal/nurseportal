            <ul>
                <li><span>MS is the most common chronic neurological disorder in young adults.</span></li>
                <li><span>It tends to be most common in countries furthest from the equator.</span></li>
                <li><span>Race, gender, genetics and environmental factors can influence the incidence
                    of the disease.</span></li>
                <li><span>While MS is typically classified into four main types, the prognosis can vary
                    considerably between patients</span></li>
                <li><span>The nervous system is divided onto components – the central nervous system
                    (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).</span></li>
                <li><span>Together they relay both physical and cognitive information about macro and
                    microenvironments in and around the body, using electrical impulses as the signally
                    device.</span></li>
                <li><span>The sheath that surrounds an axon fibre is made of myelin and this is vital
                    for the generation and propagation of electrical signals along the axon fibre.</span></li>
                <li><span>In MS, this myelin sheath is attacked by a person’s own immune system and
                    destroyed.</span></li>
                <li><span>The immune system protects us from pathogens and responds to injury. It has
                    several important characteristics: diversity, specificity, the ability to distinguish
                    self from non-self, and memory.</span></li>
                <li><span>The normal immune system can recognise a wide variety of pathogens, leave
                    its own tissue alone and remember a previous exposure to a foreign pathogen and
                    response.</span></li>
                <li><span>Some T and B cells also have the ability to react to self-antigens. A normally
                    operating immune system keeps these autoreactive immune cells in check so that they
                    do not provoke unwanted responses</span></li>
                <li><span>If the immune system is dysregulated, tolerance to some self-antigens may
                    be disrupted and autoreactive T and B cells will mistakenly damage a person’s own
                    tissues. This is the case in an autoimmune <br />disease such as MS.</span></li>
                <li><span>The pathophysiology of MS comprises of two components: inflammation and neurodegeneration.</span></li>
                <li><span>Relapses are the clinical expression of acute inflammatory demyelination,
                    whereas progression reflects neurodegenerative processes, including axonal loss,
                    with increasing brain atrophy.</span></li>
                <li><span>Recent research suggests that inflammation and neurodegeneration happen at,
                    or near, the same time.</span></li>
                <li><span>The major cause of symptoms such as paralysis, blindness and numbness is conduction
                    block in the nerves. This is largely caused by demyelination and inflammation.</span></li>
                <li><span>The sensitivity of these symptoms to changes in body temperature is well recognised.</span></li>
                <li><span>Symptoms such as tingling are due to ectopic bursts of impulses and the triggering
                    of other spurious impulses by the transmission of normal impulses in the areas of
                    demyelination.</span></li>
                <li><span>Cognitive impairment is probably due to lesions associated with the cerebral
                    cortex.</span></li>
