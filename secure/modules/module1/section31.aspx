                A sound knowledge of the pathophysiology of MS is important to the MS Nurse as one
                of the most common questions asked by people with MS is ‘What causes this disease?.’
                It is therefore important to be able to provide a clear answer that helps patients
                gain greater insight into their condition and provides a foundation for their understanding
                the rationale of their treatment, both in terms of their prescribed medication and
                the all-important self-management that they will be recommended to undertake.

                The pathophysiology of MS also includes the mechanisms underlying the inflammation
                and degeneration of the nervous system that typically occurs in MS. This has practical
                implications for the use of the currently available disease-modifying therapies,
                and ongoing and future research efforts. This knowledge provides a framework for
                rational treatment selection, helps to anticipate response and aids the understanding
                of adverse events, should they occur.
