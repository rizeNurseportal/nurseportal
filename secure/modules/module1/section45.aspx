			Optic neuritis (ON) is caused by acute inflammation of the optic nerve that results
			in painful loss of vision. It is the most commonly encountered optic neuropathy
			in clinical practice<sup>74,75</sup> and is often associated with MS<sup>76</sup>. However, between attacks
			optic nerves can undergo recovery of vision.

		<p>
			Optic Neuritis may be due to demyelination and inflammation of the optic nerve and its lining,
			resulting in inflammation of the extraocularrecti muscles that surround the optic
			nerve. Recti muscle involvement results in ocular pain, especially with eye movements.
			Regardless of etiology, inflammatory cells surround the optic nerve resulting in
			swelling and fragmentation of the nerve tissue which are subsequently phagocytised
			by macrophages, resulting in further degeneration of the nerve and the signs of
			optic nerve dysfunction<sup>77</sup>.
