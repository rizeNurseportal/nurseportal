			Fatigue is a frequent symptom of patients with multiple sclerosis<sup>63</sup>. It has a severe
			effect on their quality of life<sup>67</sup>, but its pathophysiologic mechanisms remain incompletely
			understood. One explanation is that fatigue in MS could be due to impaired selecting
			and planning of actions, as well as integrating different information, rather than
			the extent of physical disability and motor impairment<sup>68-71</sup>. This is in line with
			a model proposed by Chaudhuri and Behan, stating that there is, "failure to initiate
			and/or sustain attention task (mental fatigue) and physical activities (physical
			fatigue) requiring self-motivation<sup>72</sup>.
