			The immune system is highly specialised and comprises many different cell types,
			and many complex mechanisms. It evolved as a means to protect the body against specific
			threats, including microorganisms, certain molecules, such as toxins, and internal
			threats such as malignancies. The immune system:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span>Is antigen specific – it recognises proteins or glycoproteins on an invading
				cell’s membrane </span></li>
			<li><span>Is systemic – the components are found in the systemic circulation</span></li>
			<li><span>Has memory – once the body recognises an antigen, it retains the capacity
				to raise an immune response against that antigen should it appear in the body again.</span></li>
		</ul>

		<h3>
			3.5.1 Innate and Adaptive Immunity</h3>
		<p>
			The immune system has two distinct functions which interact to protect the body
			against dangerous organisms and compounds that enter the body:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span>the more primitive <b>innate immune system</b> (the first line of non-specific defense
				against infection by other organisms)</span></li>
			<li><span>the <b>adaptive immune system</b> composed of highly specialised, systemic cells
				and processes that eliminate or prevent pathogenic growth. It provides the ability
				to recognise and remember specific pathogens (to generate immunity), and to mount
				stronger attacks each time the pathogen is encountered. </span></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			All immune system cells derive from stem cells in the bone marrow. After proliferating
			as non-specialised stem cells, they begin to specialise into lymphoid and myeloid
			cell types.
		</p>
		<div class="keypoint">

		</div>
		<p>
			Lymphoid cells (T and B lymphocytes) are very specific in their actions and are
			part of the adaptive immune response. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Lymphoid cells differentiate into either 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup5">B cells</a> or 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup6">T cells</a>, 
            depending on whether they are produced in
			the marrow (B cells) or are produced in the marrow and migrate to the thymus, where
			they mature (T cells). They each display a unique type of receptor on their surfaces
			and so only recognise one specific type of antigen (see Figure 12).
		</p>
		<div id="deepdivepopup5" class="deepdivepopup">
			<p>
				B-cells migrate to the spleen, lymph nodes and mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue
				(MALT). They are responsible for producing and secreting antibodies. They can differentiate
				into plasma B cells, which produce antibodies in response to antigen challenges
				and memory B cells (which carry antibody or receptor for a specific antigen, formed
				after its first exposure to that antigen). When stimulated by a second exposure
				to the antigen, memory B cells mount a more rapid and effective immune response
				than a B-cell that has not been previously exposed.

				T cells mature in the thymus and then concentrate in secondary lymphoid organs where
				they differentiate into cytotoxic T cells (also known as CD8+T cells) or Helper
				T cells (also known as CD4+ T cells). T cells are stimulated by macrophages that
				have engulfed invading cells or viruses, partially digested them and then presented
				various parts of the invader on their cell surface together with a cell marker of
				their own from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This stimulates cytotoxic
				T cells to react by releasing toxic chemicals to kill the infected cells. Cytotoxic
				T cells also stimulate T cells to differentiate into:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Killer T cells (kill cells expressing antigens for which they are specific)</span></li>
				<li><span>Helper T cells (stimulate T and B cells)</span></li>
				<li><span>Regulatory T cells (inhibit T and B cells and wind down the immune response
					once the attack is completed) </span></li>
				<li><span>Memory T cells (remember antigens for future encounters)</span></li>

			Lymphocytes that recognise ‘self’ are normally rapidly and effectively destroyed
			as soon as they emerge. This process fails in the case of autoimmune disease.

		<h3>
			3.5.2 Innate Immunity</h3>
		<p>
			Myeloid cells respond early and non-specifically to infection and form the innate
			immune response.
		</p>
		<p>
			The innate immune system is a genetically determined, non-specific defence mechanism
			that provides an immediate barrier to infection. It lacks specificity and memory,
			and does not confer long-lasting or protective immunity. However, it does play a
			vital role in activating the adaptive immune system through the process of antigen
			presentation.
		</p>
		<p>
			The cellular mediators of the innate immune system are phagocytes (monocytes, macrophages,
			dendritic cells and granulocytes) and natural killer (NK) cells; the soluble components
			are complement proteins and cytokines, among others.
		</p>
		<a name="3" id="3"></a>
		<h3>
			3.5.3 Adaptive Immunity</h3>
		<p>
			There are two types of specific adaptive immune response: the humoral immune responses
			and the cellular response. T cells are the effective mediators of the 
            <a href="#"	class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup7">cellular response</a>, 
            while antibodies secreted by B cells are the effectors of the 
            <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup8">	humoral response</a>.
		</p>
		<div id="deepdivepopup7" class="deepdivepopup">
			<b>Cellular or cell-mediated immunity</b>
			<p>
				This is where the white cells are engaged in immune activity. Principally lymphocytes
				are involved, some of which act directly by destroying foreign cells, or indirectly
				by releasing chemical mediators that enhance the inflammatory response or activate
				cells to destroy the invaders.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="deepdivepopup8" class="deepdivepopup">
			<b>Humoral immunity</b>
			<p>
				The immune system mainly works by producing antibodies against antigens. Antibodies
				are molecules produced by B lymphocytes and they circulate in the blood and the
				lymph. They attach to antigens displayed by invading bacteria, viruses or other
				organisms, and either inactivate them or facilitate their destruction by cells of
				the immune system.

				In what way would you describe the function of the immune system to a person with
				MS?
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="nursetippopup" id="nursetip1">
			<p>
				A sound knowledge of the pathophysiology of MS is important as one of the most common
				questions asked by people with MS is ‘What causes this disease?”
			</p>
			<p>
				I normally begin by explaining about the nervous system and how it is divided into
				essentially two components:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>the central nervous system (CNS)</span></li>
				<li><span>the peripheral nervous system (PNS): which consists of nerves outside the
					brain and spinal cord.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The CNS consists of the brain and the spinal cord, plus the optic nerve. It is the
				body’s primary command and coordination system, receiving and processing incoming
				data and instructing responses. The CNS is made up of many types of cells including
				the neurons. Neurons are the cells that send messages from the brain to the body
				and back. Neurons are made up of the cell body and the axon which is like a long
				tail. The axon is often covered in a protective coating called myelin. In MS, myelin
				is attacked by the patient’s own immune system and compromised, resulting in hardened
				plaques called scleroses. When the myelin is damaged axons may also be destroyed.
				These areas of damage are often seen on MRI scans and many produce symptoms of MS.
			</p>
			<p>
				The immune system protects us from pathogens and responds to injury. The normal
				immune system can recognise a wide variety of pathogens, leave its own tissue alone
				and remember a previous exposure to a foreign pathogen. However, if the immune system
				is abnormal, immune cells such as T and B cells will mistakenly damage a person’s
				own tissues. This is the case in an autoimmune disease such as MS. Research suggests
				that MS is a consequence of an abnormal autoimmune response to myelin that develops
				after exposure to some environmental agent in genetically predisposed individuals.
				The combined effects of this autoimmune response cause demyelination, axonal damage
				and scarring, and account for the new brain and spinal lesions seen on the MRI of
				people with MS.

			3.5.4 Summary</h3>
		<div class="icon_summary">
			<ul class="noindent">
				<li><span>The immune system protects us from pathogens and responds to injury. It has
					several important characteristics: diversity, specificity, the ability to distinguish

				<li><span>The normal immune system can recognise a wide variety of pathogens, leave
					its own tissue alone and remember a previous exposure to a foreign pathogen and

				<li><span>Some T and B cells also have the ability to react to self-antigens. A normally
					operating immune system keeps these autoreactive immune cells in check so that they
					do not provoke unwanted responses</span></li>
				<li><span>However, if the immune system is dysregulated, tolerance to some self-antigens
					may be disrupted and autoreactive T and B cells will mistakenly damage a person’s
