			4.8 Cognitive Impairment in MS</h2>
		<p>
			Depending on the disease phase and type, 40–65% of people with MS develop various
			degrees of cognitive dysfunction. Pathological and MRI studies have failed to demonstrate
			the existence of a strict relationship between cognitive impairment and subcortical
			white matter pathology. The correlation is also poor when MRI metrics of whole brain
			(white plus gray matter) atrophy are considered. Over the past decade, increasing
			observations have provided evidence of a primary role of cortical pathology – that
			is, inflammatory focal lesions (cortical lesions) and atrophy (cortical thickness)
			–in determining global and/or selective cognitive disability in patients with MS.
			By applying a new technique, it has been observed that specific cognitive deficits,
			such as memory impairment, attention deficits and reduced mental processing speed,
			could be better explained by cortical structural abnormalities than by subcortical
			white matter lesions. Therefore, MRI evaluation of cortical pathology should be
			included in the routine examination of people with MS, especially those with initial
			signs/symptoms of cognitive dysfunction.

			These observations were borne out by a study by Calabrese and colleagues in which
			24 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (34.3%) were classified as cognitively impaired<sup>82</sup>.
			The study provided evidence that the burden of cortical lesions and tissue loss
			are among the major structural changes associated with cognitive impairment in relapsing-remitting
			MS.
