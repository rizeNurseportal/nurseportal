            <ul>
                <li><span>Appreciate the importance of understanding the pathophysiology of MS as a
                    foundation for making decisions concerning the management of MS</span></li>
                <li><span>Identify the various types of MS and know their natural history and progression</span></li>
                <li><span>State the genetic, race, gender and environmental factors which affect the
                    incidence of MS</span></li>
                <li><span>Describe the structure of the nervous system and how its function is altered
                    by MS</span></li>
                <li><span>Explain the function of the immune system and how its role is disrupted by
                    MS.</span></li>
                <li><span>Describe the underlying pathophysiological causes of the most common symptoms
                    associated with MS</span></li>
                <li><span>Recognise that central to this is the inflammation and demyelination of axons
                    which disrupts neural conduction </span></li>
                <li><span>Appreciate that cortical pathology, that is, inflammatory focal lesions (cortical
                    lesions) and atrophy (cortical thickness), may determine cognitive disability in
                    MS.</span></li>
