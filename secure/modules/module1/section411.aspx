				<li><span>The major cause of symptoms such as paralysis, blindness and numbness is conduction
					block in the nerves. This is largely caused by demyelination and inflammation.</span></li>
				<li><span>The sensitivity of these symptoms to changes in body temperature is well recognised.</span></li>
				<li><span>Symptoms such as tingling are due to ectopic bursts of impulses and the triggering
					of other spurious impulses by the transmission of normal impulses in the areas of
					demyelination.</span></li>
				<li><span>Cognitive impairment is probably due to lesions associated with the cerebral
					cortex.</span></li>
