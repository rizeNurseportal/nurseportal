			Between 60% and 80% of individuals diagnosed with MS have been reported as being
			sensitive to environmental heat<sup>58</sup>. Indeed, blurred vision, known as Uthoff's phenomenon
			and first described in 1890, is caused by increased body temperature due to physical
			exercise or physical restraint<sup>59</sup>. In a multinational Internet-based survey of people
			with MS (n=2,529), 70% reported that high temperatures worsened their MS (e.g. taking
			a hot shower or using the hair drier); while drinking a glass of cold water could
			relief symptoms<sup>60</sup>.

			The heat reaction blocks the action potential/conduction block of the demyelinated
			neuron<sup>59,61</sup>. The demyelination results in a slower nerve conduction velocity. Interestingly,
			very small increases in temperature (due to both external conditions and exercise)
			can also block action potentials<sup>61,62</sup>. Patients’ reports of temperature aberrations
			can vary greatly, indicating that the mechanisms may be multiple.
		</p>
		<p>
			After normalisation of the temperature, signs and symptoms usually improve or disappear<sup>58,59</sup>.
			Heat sensitivity has been described as a significant correlate of the symptom of
			fatigue in MS<sup>63-65</sup>.
