		<h2>
			2.5 Factors Contributing to MS</h2>
		<p>
			Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to the aetiology of MS, and genetic
			factors also contribute to MS susceptibility. MS is particularly prevalent in populations
			from Northern Europe and their descendants, including those living in Australia,
			New Zealand and North America. It has been suggested that MS is more frequent in
			areas settled by Vikings and Goths, and that migrants from these areas took this
			susceptibility throughout Europe, the New World, South Africa, Australia and New
			Zealand<sup>16</sup>. Other prevalence rates are as follows<sup>17,18</sup>:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><span>United Kingdom: 80–250 per 100,000</span></li>
			<li><span>Scandinavia: 32–93 per 100,000</span></li>
			<li><span>Northern United States (above 37°N): 69 per 100,000</span></li>
			<li><span>Asia, Africa, South America: 5 per 100,000</span></li>
			<li><span>Canada: 150–200 per 100,000</span></li>
			<li><span>Orkney and Shetland Islands, and South East Scotland: 250 per 100,000 population
				– this is the highest prevalence rate in the world.</span></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The prevalence of MS significantly increases for each degree of northern latitude,
			by 1.5% in men (p = 0.013) and 1% in women (p = 0.015). Equatorial countries are
			usually the areas of low risk, while the northernmost and southernmost countries
			tend to be areas of high risk<sup>7</sup>.
		</p>
		<div class="keypoint">
			Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to the aetiology of MS, and genetic
			factors also contribute to MS susceptibility.
		</div>
		<p>
			People will often enquire why they have MS. There is no one cause and the disease
			is multifactorial – including genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, viral
			exposure and possibly hormonal interplay.
		</p>
		<p>
			MS nurses need to have an understanding of the current concepts of MS etiology and
			the pathological changes that are characteristic of the disease, so that they are
			better able to address the concerns of their patients and their families.
		</p>

		<h3>
			2.5.1 Race</h3>
		<p>
			MS affects Caucasians more than other races<sup>19</sup>. MS was virtually unknown
			among black Africans, although, of late, there are increasing reports amongst these
			races. Indeed, while MS has a higher incidence in Caucasian Americans than in African
			Americans, the latter may have a more aggressive disease course and experience greater
			disability<sup>20</sup>. Migration studies are particularly interesting when studying
			the cause of MS. The potential for developing MS may be established in early life.
			Thus, if a person is born in a high risk area (e.g. Northern Europe, Northern USA,
			Southern Canada, Southern Australia or New Zealand) but moves to a low risk area
			(e.g. Asia, Latin America, Middle East) before the age of 15 years, he or she will
			assume the low risk potential. Equally, people of Japanese origin living in the
			USA are more likely to develop MS than those living in Japan<sup>21</sup>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some ethnic groups show disproportionately low frequencies of MS, e.g. Maltese,
			Innuits, Lapps, Siberians, Hungarian Gypsies and Central Asians<sup>15</sup>.

		<h3>
			2.5.2 Age</h3>
		<p>
			Although MS can occur at any age, the average age at diagnosis is approximately
			30 years worldwide. Childhood MS is uncommon (~5% of cases), and paediatric presentation
			is generally one of relapses of sensory symptoms. More than 90% of the paediatric
			MS population have RRMS. Disease course is usually slower than in adults, but significant
			disability may still occur by early adulthood. It is not clear at the onset of symptoms
			which children will go on to develop MS<sup>22</sup>.

		<h3>
			2.5.3 Gender</h3>
		<p>
			Like the majority of other autoimmune diseases, MS predominately affects women.
			The ratio of women to men with MS is approximately 2:1. This is consistent with
			the phenomenon that women, especially during childbearing years, are more likely
			to have autoimmune diseases. Women in high risk areas have a lifetime risk of 1
			in 200<sup>23</sup>. Moreover, MS symptoms are affected by the normal ebb and flow
			of hormones during the menstrual cycle<sup>24</sup>. The only exception to this
			is PPMS, in which the female preponderance is absent. However, when present, MS
			tends to be more severe in men and the male gender is typically associated with
			a poor prognosis<sup>25</sup>.
		</p>
		<div class="keypoint">
			MS tends to be more severe in men and the male gender is typically associated with

		</div>
		<p>
			Sex hormones are known to play a central role as modulators of the immune response
			in autoimmune diseases. Use of hormone replacement therapy may be associated with
			a lower risk of MS – suggesting that sex hormones may have a role in the decrease
			in relapse rates observed during pregnancy and the increase seen following delivery.
			More studies are needed to determine the precise relationship between MS and hormonal
			imbalances.
		</p>

		<h3>
			2.5.4 Genetics</h3>
		<p>
			Some of the geographic variation of this disease may result from genetic predisposition.
			Family studies and <a href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup2">twin studies</a>
			have shown that there is a strong genetic component underlying the etiology of multiple
			sclerosis. The rate of MS among family members of an individual affected by the
			disease is higher than would be expected by chance. The prevalence of this disease
			among first-degree relatives of affected individuals is 20 to 40 times higher than
			the overall population<sup>26</sup>. However, this cannot be entirely attributed
			to genetics, as most family members share a similar environment and lifestyle.
		</p>
        
        <div class="keypoint">
            The 20% of people with MS have a positive family history.
        </div>
		<p>
			One of the most common questions a newly diagnosed person with MS will ask is <a
				href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup1">“Is MS inherited?”</a> When counselling
			people with MS and their relatives it should be explained that the risk for first-degree
			relatives of people with MS is greater than the risk for second-degree relatives.
			Overall, siblings have the highest age-adjusted risk, followed by parents, then
			children, then uncles, aunts and cousins<sup>26</sup> (Figure 4).
		</p>
		<div id="deepdivepopup1" class="deepdivepopup">
			<p>
				One UK study examined the risks of developing MS in both first- and second-degree
				relatives of an MS patient and reported the following figures<sup>27</sup>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Sister = 4.4%</span></li>
				<li><span>Brother= 3.2%</span></li>
				<li><span>Parent = 2.1%</span></li>
				<li><span>Child = 1.8%</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Where both parents have MS, the risk to their children is higher, approaching 20%.</p>

        <p>
			Some specific gene markers have been identified as possible causative genes in MS,
			although their consistency across the MS population has yet to be established. Patients
			may ask for genetic counselling if they are planning a family, but because of the
			complexity of genetics and the interplay of genetic and environmental factors, genetic
			screening or counselling is difficult. There is currently no genetic testing for
			MS available. There is an association with certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
			alleles, such as HLA-DR2, and the development of MS<sup>28</sup>. Other non-HLA
			genes may also play a role in MS susceptibility.
		</p>
		<p>
			MS is not an exclusively inherited disease as shown by <a href="#" class="deepdive"
				rel="deepdivepopup2">twin data</a>. The higher concordance rate for monozygotic
			twins (25–34%) than for dizygotic twins (2–5%) indicates a high heritability. Various
			genetic studies have examined the risk of the disease to family members of an affected
			individual. Thus, those genetically identical (monozygotic twins) have the highest
			risk (~25–34%), and those genetically unrelated (general population) have the lowest
			risk (~0.1–0.2% in high risk areas). Adoptees have a comparable risk to the general
			population indicating that living with an affected individual has little or no effect
			on one’s susceptibility in the absence of biological relatedness<sup>7,26</sup>.Researchers
			have concluded that both genetic susceptibility and environmental influences affect
			the development and clinical manifestations of MS<sup>29</sup>.
		</p>
        <div class="keypoint">
           Genetic susceptibility and environmental influences affect the development and
            clinical manifestations of MS.
        </div>
		<p>
			Because there are no tests to evaluate the genetic susceptibility of people to MS,
			it is difficult to counsel patients who want to know their chances of passing the
			disease on to their children. The best we can do is to evaluate the family history
			and be empathetic.
		</p>
		<div id="deepdivepopup2" class="deepdivepopup">
			<p>
				In theory, if genes were solely responsible for determining the risk of the development
				of MS, then it would follow that if one monozygotic twin were diagnosed with MS,
				then there would be a 100% chance of the other twin also developing the disease.
				In fact, this is not the case. In a Canadian study of twin pairs, Sadovnick and
				colleagues followed up their study group for 7.5 years<sup>30</sup>. They discovered
				the concordance rate is approximately 30% in monozygotic twins, which contrasts
				with the rate in dizygotic twins of approximately 4.7%. The rate in the latter group
				is roughly the same risk as in non-twin siblings.
			</p>
			<p>
				Recent studies have highlighted the fact that monozygotic twins might not actually
				be genetically or epigenetically identical<sup>31</sup>. Baranzini and colleagues sequenced
				the genome from a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for multiple sclerosis, and
				also examined DNA methylation and gene expression across the genome<sup>32</sup>. No consistent
				difference in DNA sequence, DNA methylation or gene expression was found between
				affected and unaffected twins. This result suggests that the environment is the
				key driver of twin discordance.
			</p>
			<p>
				This has led to the conclusion that up to 75% of MS cases must be due to non-genetic
				factors<sup>33,34</sup>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<a name="5" id="5"></a>
		<h3>
			2.5.5 Vitamin D</h3>
		<p>
			Another factor believed to contribute to MS is dietary and sunlight-activated <a
				href="#" class="deepdive" rel="deepdivepopup3">vitamin D</a> in the body<sup>35</sup>.
			Geographical gradients have been observed repeatedly in MS, with disease prevalence
			rates increasing at higher latitudes – i.e. with increasing distance from the equator.
		</p>
		<div id="deepdivepopup3" class="deepdivepopup">
			<p>
				The effects of vitamin D on the immune system and in the CNS are increasingly understood,
				as are the underlying effects of vitamin D in MS. Experimental studies have shown
				that the biologically active metabolite of vitamin D is able to skew the composition
				of T cells into a more anti-inflammatory and regulated state<sup>36</sup>. The geographical
				distribution of MS may thus be explained by the vitamin D hypothesis.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
			The hygiene hypothesis – the idea that our modern, ultra-clean living conditions
			induce hyper-reactivity of the immune system – may also play a role, since the geographical
			distribution also coincides with the location of the ‘first-world’ countries<sup>37</sup>.
		</p>
		<a name="6" id="6"></a>
		<h3>
			2.5.6 The Role of Stress in MS</h3>
		<p>
			The concept that stress might trigger MS relapses dates back a long time and has
			been borne out in more recent studies. For instance, in patients living in a war
			zone there was a significant increase in MS relapses<sup>38</sup>.
		</p>
		<a name="7" id="7"></a>
		<h3>
			2.5.7 Smoking and MS</h3>
		<p>
			Smoking has been observed to play a contributory role in MS. Epidemiology studies
			have shown smoking increases the risk of MS by 40–80%<sup>39</sup>. Children exposed to cigarette
			smoke (i.e. passive smoking) are also at an increased risk of developing MS – and
			the longer the exposure, the higher the risk<sup>39</sup>. There are conflicting data as to
			whether cigarette smoking is a risk factor for transforming RRMS to SPMS.
		</p>
		<p>
			Among people with MS, smoking is associated with higher levels of disability, greater
			number of enhancing T2 and T1 lesions, greater lesion volume and more brain atrophy<sup>40</sup>.
		</p>
		<a name="8" id="8"></a>
		<h3>
			2.5.8 Viral Factors</h3>
		<div class="centeredimage">
			<div class="imagegroup">
				<img src="images/2_m1_sneeze_photo.jpg" alt="A photo of a male sneezing into a tissue" title="A photo of a male sneezing into a tissue" />
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			Several studies suggest that MS and its accompanying exacerbations are associated
			with viral or microbial infections<sup>41</sup>. For instance, a relapse may be
			triggered following a viral infection such as an upper respiratory infection<sup>42</sup>.
			Many viral triggers have been cited, for example paramyxo virus, coronavirus, Epstein-Barr
			virus, herpes zoster, herpes simplex virus, human herpes virus, measles and rubella<sup>43</sup>.

				How might you describe some of the current theories about causes of MS to someone

			<p>
				How would you check the person has understood the information you have given them?
			</p>
		</div>
		<div id="nursetippopup1" class="nursetippopup">
			<p>
				There are several theories about what causes MS and newly diagnosed patients often
				want to know “How did I get this disease?” This is important to explain because
				without a clear understanding they often deny they have the disease and may choose
				not to treat with disease modifying therapies. Both environmental and genetic factors
				contribute to the aetiology of MS, and genetic factors also contribute to MS susceptibility.
				MS is particularly prevalent in populations from Northern Europe and their descendants.

				attention should be paid to any specific questions they may have such as a history
				of MS in the family. All of this information can be reviewed when a discussion about
				disease modifying therapies is held. Patients can also be asked to repeat in their
				own words their understanding of the causes.
