			2.2 Overview of MS</h2>
		<p>
			The distribution of MS varies throughout the world and appears to be related to
			geographical location and genetic background. Worldwide, it is estimated that up
			to 2.5 million people are affected by MS and it is more common in cooler climates<sup>1</sup>.
			Globally, the median estimated incidence of MS is 2.5 per 100,000 (with a range
			of 1.1–4)<sup>2</sup>. Regionally, the median estimated incidence of MS is greatest
			in Europe (3.8 per 100,000), followed by the Eastern Mediterranean (2), the Americas
			(1.5), the Western Pacific (0.9) and Africa (0.1). Twice as many women are affected
			with the disease than men (lifetime risk of MS: 2.5% for women and 1.4% for men)<sup>3</sup>.
			The incidence appears to be highest between the ages of 35 and 64 years<sup>4</sup>.

			MS is the most common serious, chronic neurological disorder in young adults<sup>5</sup>.
			It is a progressive, autoimmune, degenerative disease, and is characterised by neuro
			inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS), mainly of the white matter, which
			results from a mix of clinical, pathological and immunological components, together
			with an interaction between genes and the environment<sup>6</sup>. The disease usually
			begins between the ages of 20 and 40 years and is more common in young females than
			males. However, men often have a later onset of disease and a worse prognosis<sup>7</sup>.
			In either gender, it is often diagnosed at a time when family and job responsibilities
			are at their most demanding and this results in a serious socioeconomic impact on
			the family<sup>8,9</sup>.
		</p>
		<p>
			MS can cause an unpredictable and diverse range of neurological impairments that
			are unique to each individual. Since neurological damage can affect any part of
			the CNS, MS can cause a variety of distressing symptoms, including fatigue, visual
			impairment, urinary and bowel incontinence, mobility problems, spasticity, tremor,
			pain, sexual dysfunction, depression and cognitive dysfunction. Many people with
			MS experience multiple symptoms concurrently and 90% of people with MS experience
			these at an early stage. The majority will go on to develop progressive disability<sup>8</sup>.
			It is this diversity of symptoms, and the unpredictable nature of MS, that makes
			it one of the most difficult neurological diseases with which to cope.
		</p>
		<p>
			Reported survival times among people with MS have varied considerably in the past,
			but more recent studies have demonstrated some reproducible statistics. For instance,
			British people with MS were recently reported to have a 3.5-fold increase in mortality
			compared with the general population<sup>10</sup>. Smoking and respiratory diseases
			were reported as the major factors associated with the increased mortality. In a
			Norwegian study, the median survival time from onset of MS was 41 years compared
			with 49 years in the corresponding population, and mortality was increased 2.5 fold<sup>11</sup>.
			Median survival times were longer amongst relapsing-remitting MS (43 years) than
			in patients with primary-progressive (PP) disease (49 years), and the relative mortality
			risk (RMR) was higher in PPMS (RMR = 1.55). According to death certificates, 57%
			died from MS. Similarly, a large Canadian study involving 6,917 patients with MS
			found an overall standardised mortality ratio of 2.89 in people with MS and MS patients
			survived approximately 6 years less than expected relative to the general population<sup>12</sup>.
