			MS may be related to several psychiatric disorders which disturb mood, behaviour
			and personality. Among those disorders, depression is the most frequently reported<sup>79</sup>.Psychiatric
			symptoms are commonly observed during disease evolution, but they are unusual as
			first symptoms and their occurrence is estimated at 1% of MS cases.

		<p>
			People with MS show psychiatric disorders secondary to demyelinating lesions at
			the temporal lobe. The physiopathology of this observation is not fully understood<sup>80,81</sup>.
			The temporal lobe functions are language, memory and emotion. Lesions at this brain
			location may cause hallucinations, mood and thought disorder, euphoria, irritability
			and cognitive deficit. This brain location is especially associated with psychiatric
			alteration<sup>80</sup>.
