			MS can affect the extrinsic neurological control of gut and sphincter function.
		</div>
		<p>
			Bowel function and continence depend on the integrity of bowel transit, pelvic floor
			muscle function, anorectal sensation, the motivation to maintain bowel control,
			and the ability to access the toilet. MS can affect the extrinsic neurological control
			of gut and sphincter function. This can occur at any level of the neural hierarchy.
			For example, emotional disturbance due to frontal lobe involvement can lead to behavioural
			disturbances which can cause failure of pelvic floor relaxation or ignoring of the
			call to stool. Involvement of cerebral centres of autonomic control may diminish
			colonic motor function.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is also evidence for involvement of motor spinal pathways in people with MS
			with bowel dysfunction. Other factors which could affect bowel function include
			muscle weakness, spasticity, fatigue and poor mobility. Some medications affect
			visceral function, for example, anticholinergics prescribed for bladder dysfunction,
			antidepressants or antispastics.
