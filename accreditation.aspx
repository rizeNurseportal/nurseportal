            Programme Overview
        </h2>
        <p>
            MS Nurse Professional is a pan-European, modular, CME-accredited training curriculum
            for nurses, providing up-to-date information on MS. It has been developed to support
            the attainment of necessary skills for MS Nurses and also to set the benchmark for
            core competencies leading to improved consistency of practice, irrespective of geography,
            to further benefit people with MS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Authored by leading experts in the field of MS, this online programme provides five
            comprehensive, interactive modules. Each module focuses on a different aspect of
            MS and together they form the core training curriculum. Additional elements are
            also available, including nursing tips and clinical case-based scenarios, to help
            the learner apply the knowledge acquired to real-world clinical practice.
        </p>
        <p>
            MS Nurse Professional offers international and, where available, country specific accreditation. Nursing education credits are available and are dependent upon completion 
            of all activities available on MS Nurse Professional. This accreditation should not be confused with the certification examination offered by the Multiple Sclerosis 
            Nursing International Certification Board (MSNICB) and supported by the IOMSN. Please <a href="http://ptcny.com/clients/msnicb/index.html#MultipleSclerosisNursing" target="_blank">click here</a>  
            if you would like to view the certfication examination as an activity independent of this project.
