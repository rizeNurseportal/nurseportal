		Mission Statement</h2>
	<p>
		MS Nurses play an integral role in providing support and advice on everyday issues
		for people with MS and co-ordinate a collaborative approach to management. However,
		as the responsibilities of the MS Nurse continue to expand, the findings of the
		largest survey of MS Nurses across Europe MS-NEED: European Survey (2010), highlighted
		that there are significant disparities in the provision and quality of service provided
		by MS Nurses. Therefore, there is a need to not only raise awareness
		of the role of the MS Nurse, but also to standardise their training in order to
		underpin their position in the management of MS and to optimise care for people
		with MS.
	</p>
	<h2>MS Nurse Professional</h2>
	<p>
		The mission of MS Nurse Professional, developed by the MS-NEED Study Group, is:

			European MS Nurses, in line with the recently published MS Nurse Consensus Paper
			titled “Moving Towards the Pan-European Unification and Recognition of MS Nurses”</li>
		<li>To increase the competency of MS Nurses in patient / family advocacy and brokerage,
			health education, symptom and treatment management</li>
		<li>To develop leadership skills for the advancement of patient care</li>

		MS Nurse Professional and the accompanying Consensus Paper supports the European
		Commission’s Modernising the Professional Qualifications Directive (2005/36/EC),

		(including those from the health sector) want to provide their services or establish
		themselves in another Member State.
